00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Eric Severson: Good morning.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Caroline Walters: Hi, good morning!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Caroline Walters: Do you have a good ride?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Eric Severson: I'm so sore, I can almost fall over, so it's been…

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Eric Severson: been 5 weeks. I was sick for 2, uh, and then 2 trips to Alabama, so… and then the holidays, and the kids were here for 2 full weeks, and so…

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Caroline Walters: Um…

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Eric Severson: We are doing a solid detox, both the South Beach diet and no alcohol, for all of this month.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Caroline Walters: Oh, wow!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Eric Severson: Which is good, right? It feels good, but it sucks because every night at 5 o'clock, I'm like, yeah, gee, it's the end of the day!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Caroline Walters: Uh-huh, no! Yeah, yeah.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Eric Severson: Wouldn't that be nice? Uh, and then today, you know, the group that I ride with is kind of intense, and they've been recruiting young people, so…

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Eric Severson: The age is down probably between 25 and 35, and.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Eric Severson: They did not take a break, and they are a little bit too hardcore, so I got wrung out this morning.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Caroline Walters: Uh-oh, be careful!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Eric Severson: So, I wanted to, uh, chat about, uh, two things. That meeting, a quick debrief on that meeting, definitely wanted to show you and, um…

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Eric Severson: Sherri the AI integration with Zoom, and the trans…

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Caroline Walters: Okay, she's jumping on. She went to the restroom, and she'll be on with us.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, so there were two things that I wanted to hit. One, just to make sure that you saw the AI integration with Zoom in meeting, but then after meeting.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Eric Severson: Super powerful, super powerful for, um, first turning it on and making sure that it's there, and then.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Eric Severson: doing your follow-up, your after-meeting follow-up, it's gold, right? And to have transcripts mean that you can go back, and everybody's got memory moments, right? And so, Sherri and I were texting.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Eric Severson: Because she asked me, hey, did you catch that last part? And I didn't, of course, because, you know, it's. And so we missed a couple of dates, and then…

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Eric Severson: And I said, well, let's see, you can go in there and ask it the questions.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Eric Severson: The first question is a good example of a bad question. I couldn't… she said, did you miss that date? And I was like, I don't know, is it talking about all sorts of dates? Josh was.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Eric Severson: So I asked a poor question, and then she asked a more specific question, so I threw it in there. I just wanted you guys to see that, because.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Eric Severson: there's a level of efficiency and productivity in our meetings that are on Zoom based on the AI features in the meeting, but really afterwards, so…

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Eric Severson: I take those transcripts. You can go… you can use the AI in Zoom, but if it's important, you can pull them out and put them in ChatGPT, or MS Copilot, or whatever.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Eric Severson: and say, you know, give me a list of follow-up items. What do I need to do? What do they need to do? I also do it for, is there anything I could have handled differently in this conversation? And it could be an emotional intelligence thing, or it might just be.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Eric Severson: did I hit my agenda items, right? Uh…

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Eric Severson: High-stakes meetings like that, it's super, super helpful to me. I almost feel like it's a lifeline sometimes.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, so do they live in docks?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Caroline Walters: On your Zoom? Yeah.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, they should. If the meeting organizer turns it on and shares it. If they don't, I just go to ask them to do that, right? So that you can have access to it.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Eric Severson: And then, like, right now, my window, Zoom workplace window, is kind of small, and so at the bottom, I don't see.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Eric Severson: the AI companion. So, you should see the AI Companion at the bottom of your toolbar of the Zoom window. If you don't, just make the window a little bigger until it pops up.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Eric Severson: When you click on that in the middle of a meeting, you can ask it any question. I mean, it's common to say, catch me up, is there anything that I should really be paying attention to from the perspective of business development, from the perspective of.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Eric Severson: Whatever it is.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah. Yep.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Eric Severson: So, cool stuff, super glad we're using Zoom, super glad they turned it on, uh, as well. This is just one way to start to make sure that every… I don't think most people realize it's there.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and, you know, it's a great, it's a great productivity tool. Um…

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Eric Severson: You know, just for making sure that you've got.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Eric Severson: you know it's there, so…

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, I've used the AI companion, asking questions and different things, so I'm familiar with that piece.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Caroline Walters: But a lot of times… for a while, I couldn't find the transcript from the meetings, but now they've started showing up in docs.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Eric Severson: you can… you can also go to your web version of, uh, AI and download the full transcript, right? So…

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Caroline Walters: Now, I'm… tell me how to do that. Um, or do you want to go back and start over now Sherri's here? Yeah, go ahead.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Eric Severson: I'll show you how to do that.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Eric Severson: Let's just… yeah, let's get…

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Eric Severson: Yep, do a quick… do a quick reboot. Sherri can always count on me to be, I am AI obsessed, right? I wake up thinking about AI, I think about AI most of the hours of the day, and I go to sleep thinking about AI, only because.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Sherri Twitty: Rick and Tim.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Eric Severson: I think in our lifetime, there are very few things that have the potential to change our lives as much as this stuff comes along. So…

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Eric Severson: The AI companion is turned on in Zoom, which is fantastic. Uh, if your Zoom window is… so have you used it before? Do you know what I'm talking about in there?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Sherri Twitty: Yeah, I get all the… the meetings that I've had this all week, I keep getting the AI transcripts.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Sherri Twitty: So…

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Eric Severson: So the AI transcript comes afterwards, and that's super. The AI companion allows you to ask questions in the meeting, so if…

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Sherri Twitty: Mm-hmm.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Sherri Twitty: Okay.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Eric Severson: And I'll tell you, there are things like, uh, I will use it for catch-up, certainly, and I sent you two emails. One was a good example of a bad question, so I asked the AI.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Eric Severson: a vague question. When you sent me that text, I was like, I don't know, do I look like I'm catching all of this.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Eric Severson: Operational detail? Nope, I missed it too. And then I asked a bad question. A bad question because it was vague, it wasn't specific.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Eric Severson: And so it gave me the best guess, but it wasn't the answer that you were looking for. When you then asked the more specific question, I plump that into AI as well, and it's just a quick…

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Eric Severson: sort of prompt engineering thing of more specific is better. Quality input gets you quality output.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Eric Severson: And so, I will also do things like, if I'm not really clear on the implication to business development.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Eric Severson: or to university relations, or to any number of topics, I will sit there and brainstorm with the AI during the meeting to say, help me understand the implications of.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Eric Severson: maybe it's something in continuing ed that's being talked about in a leadership meeting, and I'll just ask it those questions so that I can, you know, sit there and make sure that I've got anything that's on my mind squared away.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Eric Severson: So then the transcripts. You can get the transcript through, uh… if they've turned… yep, sorry.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Caroline Walters: Show Sherri where the AI companion is located. You mind sharing your screen and just showing her how that works?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Eric Severson: I don't know that I can share this Zoom screen, but let me see if that's a… I've never tried, let's see.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Caroline Walters: I didn't even think about that, Eric!

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Sherri Twitty: I see… I see it, I see it down at the bottom of the screen, AI Companion.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Eric Severson: Okay, great. Great. Because…

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Caroline Walters: Click it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Sherri Twitty: So, I'm gonna click on it, and I'm gonna say, what the is Eric talking about?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Eric Severson: I tend…

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Eric Severson: Why does he like it? Does that guy like AI?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Sherri Twitty: Just to test, just to test, you know, so… but, um, yeah, I see it.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Eric Severson: Yes, fine. Rock and roll! Rock on!

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Eric Severson: So that's great, because if the window is too small, and I have these huge monitors, and so I often am doing a lot of things at one time, if the Zoom window is too small, the AI companion.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Eric Severson: Might not be visible. You just have to make it wide enough so that you see it, but if you see it, you're good to go.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Eric Severson: terrific for in meetings, especially if, you know, you're multitasking, and you're there not as the primary, and you want to catch caught up, or if there's ever a time, and again, for me, maybe it's the new guy thing, maybe I'm just not smart enough, but it's always helpful for me to get.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Eric Severson: hey, help me make the linkages or connections between what's being talked about and adjacent topics or ideas. So, good for that. Now, let's go to… let's say the meeting ends and they don't.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Eric Severson: automatically send out. Some will automatically send out a Zoom summary, and it's an interesting thing for us as a team to decide how do we want to handle this.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Eric Severson: You can build custom summaries, so after a certain meeting, like maybe your leadership meeting, Caroline.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Eric Severson: You can have a custom summary that includes who agreed to do what, and on what date, and you've got follow-up items, and it will automatically send them.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Eric Severson: Uh, takes a little bit of tweaking, so I find that I've got to ask it to disregard the, you know, the beginnings of meetings when we're talking about social stuff.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Eric Severson: That doesn't need to go in the… in the… in the follow-up meeting notes. Uh, but there's stuff like that that you can start to fine-tune, and it just… it makes it easy.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Caroline Walters: Hmm.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Eric Severson: And then always being able to go back to a transcript, I find is enormously freeing.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Eric Severson: there's never this… I never said that. Well, hold on. I understand that you might not remember saying that, but let's go look at the instant replay. And so it has a way of really taking any of the…

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Eric Severson: Recollection burden out of, uh, of moving forward.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Eric Severson: So, let me see if I can't get to our Zoom link here, and I'll share that with you.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Eric Severson: This is also…

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Eric Severson: Where you can set up…

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Eric Severson: Um…

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Eric Severson: Custom features…

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Eric Severson: in Zoom, so I'll share the…

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Eric Severson: Window, real quick.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Eric Severson: And…

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Sherri Twitty: Well, I'm sorry, I can't see all of this stuff, so… and I'm not gonna kill myself doing it, so I'm trying, but I'm just telling you now.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Eric Severson: It's all good. So, the goal that I have with all of this stuff is first to drive awareness. Is it because you're on laptop screen, or, uh…

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Caroline Walters: She's been to the eye doctor.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Eric Severson: Or…

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Sherri Twitty: I've, I've been to the retina specialist today and I'm not, I can't, my eyes are dilated and I'm not supposed to be straining my eyes and looking at screens.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Eric Severson: I have that coming up next… the week after next, and uh… and we put it at…

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Eric Severson: I love it when they dilate your eyes and you spend the rest of the day trying to figure out what to do.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Eric Severson: Alright, so, uh, Columbia Southern…

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Caroline Walters: So, Eric, I usually get there on my workplace app.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Eric Severson: I… so the reason I'm doing this is that I find feature and functionality here that I haven't been able to find in the Workplace app.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Caroline Walters: Oh my.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Eric Severson: So, I know it's…

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Caroline Walters: So, if you just go to the Zoom login, in general, and put your Columbia Southern address.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Caroline Walters: You should be able to log in like this.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Eric Severson: Yes, that's exactly what I just did. Now, here are the docs.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Caroline Walters: Alright.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Eric Severson: Right? So, that are… this is your meeting transcript, but I've only found this to include.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Eric Severson: I haven't found this to… like, there's not a…

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Eric Severson: transcript from that last meeting here, right? So, we don't have access to that full transcript.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Eric Severson: My pitch to, you know, the leadership here would be to.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Eric Severson: Find a way to be okay with this. What it is, when you share transcripts, you're committing to transparency.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Eric Severson: If someone has a problem with that, it's a bigger question mark about, well, why are you, uh, unsure about transparency?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Eric Severson: Well…

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Caroline Walters: So, I think that's… I think people just don't know to do it, Eric.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Eric Severson: Okay. That's…

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Caroline Walters: you know what I'm saying? I don't think it's about not being transparent, it's just, we went from RingCentral to Zoom, and we're having meetings.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Caroline Walters: And no one's evolving to share in this. And tell me again, I've got my page pulled up.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Caroline Walters: But where are the documents? Because I don't…

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Eric Severson: Oh, right here, so there's two ways. First, we'll go through the Zoom workplace.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Caroline Walters: Like, I don't see your cursor pointed at anything.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Eric Severson: Home? Oh, my bad, my bad, my bad. It helps if I share the right screen, doesn't it?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Caroline Walters: Oh, I'm like, I'm not saying anything!

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Eric Severson: The guy is so excited to teach people about stuff, but he forgets to share the screen.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Sherri Twitty: And I'm just struggling to see, and so I know I'm not, I'm like, what is going on?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Eric Severson: Now, we're back to the same problem. I don't know how to share… to use Zoom to share the Zoom workplace screen.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Caroline Walters: Do I need to click the word docs?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Eric Severson: Right.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Eric Severson: Yes, if you see across that menu bar at the top, Home, Calendar, docs.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Caroline Walters: Alright.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Eric Severson: Then, then you should see over on the left-hand side…

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Eric Severson: uh, meetings…

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Eric Severson: CR Meeting, view details… you can get a summary of the transcript, but you can't get the full one here.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Eric Severson: So, meeting, we do not have permission to view. You can request it, but I'm guessing that this is more about what you just mentioned, that people haven't had.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Eric Severson: a training session on Zoom, so they don't know that it's here, and how to get at it.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Eric Severson: Um, and so I'll… I'll, uh, you can see your docs, so here are the meeting summaries for any of the meetings that I have.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Caroline Walters: Hey, look, we're still seeing your profile screen.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Eric Severson: Right.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Eric Severson: Oh, I'm sorry. I guess maybe…

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Eric Severson: I need to think about how to do this, because again, uh, you can't share the Zoom workplace screen from Zoom. Let me try one more time and make sure that that.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Caroline Walters: Well, look, I think I can.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Eric Severson: You can?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Caroline Walters: Look!

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Eric Severson: I got a blank screen. Oh, uh, that's the website.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, and that's what… this is what we were seeing on you, was this page, except it said Eric.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Eric Severson: So, you know, the…

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Caroline Walters: And then…

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Eric Severson: The Zoom… the Zoom app is where I wanted to just quickly start there.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Caroline Walters: I'm listening.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Eric Severson: And I… let's see if we can do it this way. Maybe there's another way to do it.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Caroline Walters: Now, this is my app.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Sherri Twitty: Is all of this gonna be in the transcript?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Eric Severson: Our transcript for this meeting, yes. And so there's all sorts of junk that goes into transcripts, which is why it's helpful, but in the AI, you say ignore all this stuff, right? I just want to know, you ask questions about.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Caroline Walters: Can you…

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Sherri Twitty: Yes.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Eric Severson: What are the follow-up points, who committed to what, where, and when, that sort of stuff.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Caroline Walters: So, can you see my workplace now?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Sherri Twitty: Gotcha.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Eric Severson: I'm…

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Eric Severson: No, I can still see the website.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Caroline Walters: Ah!

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Eric Severson: But not the workplace.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Caroline Walters: Interesting.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I'm struggling with that as well, going, how do I… I can do… I can try this, but it'll be…

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Eric Severson: It'll be the whole screen, uh…

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Eric Severson: And when you, when you look at screens, the workplace screen doesn't show up.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Caroline Walters: Okay. Oh, that is so weird!

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Eric Severson: We could do a Google Meets and then show it on Zoom via Google Meets, but that seems like a whole lot of hassle. Let me just try this. I'll share my…

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Eric Severson: Full screen for a second, uh, and see how that works.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Eric Severson: Okay, so this is my full screen.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and in the center here is the Zoom workplace. Can you guys see that?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, so here, across…

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Caroline Walters: No, no, no, it's still showing your web. It's not showing workplace.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Eric Severson: So, I'm… that's crazy. So, even when you do… okay. So, not surprising, you're trying to share with the app, and it won't let you.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Eric Severson: So, I've been thinking about starting to do a series of quick YouTube videos on stuff, just to make it easier for people to consume it when they think about it.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Eric Severson: I know, uh, I know you mentioned that Ken is interested in Notebook LM. Finding a time for us all to do a 30-minute meeting, it'd be great, I'd love to do that, but I'm also thinking, gee, it might be interesting.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Eric Severson: to just start posting videos and say, here's a YouTube video I did on some things that you might be interested in when you have them in it, right? And so…

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Eric Severson: Uh, I think I'll try that. And here, with the Zoom thing, same, same deal.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Eric Severson: Um, but let's look at the website for just one second, because that is worth understanding.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Eric Severson: what's here. So here…

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Eric Severson: is the Zoom website for us.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Eric Severson: You can go down through all of these issues, but it's really recordings and transcripts.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Eric Severson: And then… transcripts.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Eric Severson: So, uh, it… these are where you can download. It keeps it for 120 days.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Caroline Walters: Hmm.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Eric Severson: Which is sort of unfortunate, you know, honestly, these things are not that big, you could probably keep them forever.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Eric Severson: But it does keep it for 120 days, so I just simply download them, and they come as text files, and I stick them in a folder called transcripts.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Eric Severson: That way, if I ever really feel compelled to go back and take a look at, what did I say? What did we agree to? So the Signal Mutual.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Eric Severson: Uh, custom CTR, CSU custom curriculum proposal, any of these things.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Eric Severson: Give me the ability to be extremely specific in my follow-up notes with people.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Eric Severson: Without having to rely on taking crazy notes by hand or remembering everything, right? So, I am not blessed with a great memory.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Eric Severson: I forget stuff all the time, which is probably a big part of why I love the AI tools and the transcripts so much.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Eric Severson: Uh, in here, there's…

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Caroline Walters: Quick question, Eric, quick question. So, if I open one of these meetings up.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Caroline Walters: It's coming, like you say, and it's got a timestamp for everyone's response. Is that what you have on your end? It's not just a pretty Word document that's transcript.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Eric Severson: No, it's not… it is definitely not a pretty Word document. It is… it is…

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Caroline Walters: Okay, I'm just making sure I'm getting the right thing, so…

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Eric Severson: that I think it's totally unusable unless you drop it into AI. ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, you drop it in there, and then you ask questions about it, right? And otherwise, it's… it's…

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Eric Severson: not… it's barely human-readable, I don't know, I've never once tried to scan through the whole thing to go, uh, what is in here?

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Eric Severson: Um, we should probably do, you know, uh, I think you can set these things to build the agendas as well, if you want to, beforehand, so everybody sees an agenda ahead of time.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Eric Severson: Um, the rest of this, other than recordings and summaries.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Eric Severson: I actually now forget where you set some of the, uh…

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Eric Severson: Some of the settings for things like…

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Eric Severson: where am I when AutoCompanion on the web, locked by admin, this is my favorite thing on the world, to see that the IT people are making bad decisions for us.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Eric Severson: Um, but you can go down through here and make sure that you're checking and enabling things. So, Meeting Summary with AI Companion.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Eric Severson: I would just check these and turn them on, right? Now, we've restricted users from sharing summaries. Again, IT, bad decision, I would say. Policy decision at some.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Eric Severson: Buddy made when they were checking the check boxes. At some point, I will either go to Scott or to Ken and say, here's some opportunities that we were being limited by.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Eric Severson: on choices, were they conscious? If they are conscious, you know, would love to know it. If they're not conscious, should probably go in and have a little bit of a debate about these things.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Eric Severson: Because again, this to me is about full transparency, and it just relieves me of either having to take notes or having to remember things.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Eric Severson: So I would definitely scroll through and look at… you can send pre-meeting email notifications. Send an email notification to the host and or participants 10 minutes before the meeting starts.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Eric Severson: There's all sorts of stuff in here that is worth looking at and going.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Eric Severson: Is this how I want it to do it? Um…

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Eric Severson: Here's the webinar summary with AI Companion. Why we have that locked? I…

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Eric Severson: Can't even imagine why that would be the case. We're not doing webinars right now, but it doesn't… it doesn't really matter, so I would just focus mostly on the meetings.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and it would be here, turn on Meeting Summary automatically when meetings start, include an email notification when sharing with users, include summary text in the email. And this is, again, in the settings.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Eric Severson: On the website. I haven't been able to find these things in the app, only on the website.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Eric Severson: So…

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Eric Severson: I'll run through… I'll look first and see if there is a good video from…

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Eric Severson: Zoom itself, and then just run through and say, here are a few things to at least consider how to use these things and how to turn them on.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Eric Severson: Um, summaries is worth looking at, too, and again, just to see, here are all your summaries for your meetings.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Eric Severson: What's a bummer is if people aren't sharing them, like, I would be… I would love to see.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Eric Severson: you're sharing them, so if you turned it on, fantastic. Here's your…

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Eric Severson: Uh, September 23rd UR leadership meeting summary.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Eric Severson: That was in there. I think this is terrific, right? So, it gives you a quick recap.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Eric Severson: It gives you next steps.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Eric Severson: Now, are all of these always exactly right? Maybe yes, maybe no, right? So, sometimes you can go in here and go, hey guys, if you see a next step that AI is picking out, but you.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Eric Severson: don't agree with, just let me know, and it's not hard and fast, right? As we're getting to know the tool in particular.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Eric Severson: A little grace around the learning curve makes a ton of sense. And then over time, we can… we can, uh…

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Eric Severson: Customize the way that you have these summaries.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Eric Severson: I love that there's one in here, so there was one and done, maybe that's when they first rolled out Zoom, and then they decided they would go in and uncheck everything.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Eric Severson: at a centralized level. I think this is, you know, this is a nice service for people to see this immediately after your meetings, to go, oh yeah, these are the things that we committed to, and here's.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Eric Severson: Here are the marching orders going forward, without you having to sit down and either, you know, write a marching orders note or any of that sort of stuff.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Eric Severson: But that's it. So, after… after sharing, like, I would love it if Dale had turned on sharing, because then we would be able to see a complete summary, and then maybe get the full.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Eric Severson: details of that last meeting. What does that get you? What dates did they mention? Give me a list of dates they mentioned that are relevant for either outreach or business development.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Eric Severson: Bang, it comes back in complete clarity.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Caroline Walters: Okay, Speedy Gonzales, I have a question for you.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Eric Severson: Yes. Yes, I am highly caffeinated this morning, so…

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Caroline Walters: I have not turned on anything. I think I push that manually after a meeting.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Eric Severson: You did? Okay.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Caroline Walters: like, you know how it'll give you a summary, then you can drop people's email addresses and share your summary? So, where in here do you go in to turn on summaries? I'm sure you showed us, but…

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Eric Severson: We'll do it again. And so, under settings…

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Caroline Walters: Yes, just go to that one… that one thing right now.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Eric Severson: Yep, under Settings on the left-hand nav bar.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Eric Severson: And then let's go to Meeting. You can do it either here or here.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Eric Severson: And then let's just roll down through. Participants can request…

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Eric Severson: Allow users to ask questions about the meeting…

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Eric Severson: share with all participants only when they join, right? So, I don't know why I have that set. I mean, you want to encourage people not to skip your meetings.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Eric Severson: But if they do miss your meeting, you can do participants and invitees in our organization.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Eric Severson: So that, that way, if they miss it, they still basically get the summary.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Eric Severson: Summary… and so, is yours checked here? Send an email notification when sharing with users?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Caroline Walters: Let me get down to it, because I had to go back and click something different to get to this.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Caroline Walters: Meeting summary with AI Companion, is that what I'm… is that what I'm looking for?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Eric Severson: it's a little bit below that. It's in the, uh, it's that, first of all, send an email notification when sharing with users.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Eric Severson: Include summary text in the email.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Caroline Walters: Alright, did that.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Eric Severson: And then down here is automatically share summary with.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Eric Severson: Only me, only meeting host, co-host, and alternate.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Eric Severson: Only me and meeting invitees in our organization is what I have selected.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and that way, it automatically goes out to anybody that I have a meeting with will then get that automatically share the summary.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Eric Severson: And then I… again, I'm… I'm trying to be good about saying to people, hey, this is new, right? So we've… this is right out of the box, I'm sure we can fine-tune it. If you see stuff that… that…

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Eric Severson: AI is committing you to as a follow-up that you don't agree with, just call me, right? We're not going to get all bent out of shape about it. It's just a tool to try to help us all.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Eric Severson: You know, be clear about what happens after the meetings.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, to my knowledge, there's been no training on how to use anything with Zoom. Sherri, are you aware of it?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Caroline Walters: I hadn't seen it.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Eric Severson: So, who on our team.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Caroline Walters: I mean, they just… this is what we're doing, damn.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Eric Severson: besides the three of us, and Tony and Dwayne, and I'll handle Tony and Dwayne in terms of.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Eric Severson: just making them aware and giving them quick training. Who else… I'm happy to do a training, if you want, with our team, but who else uses Zoom.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Eric Severson: on a regular basis, where, you know, I think the big thing is the AI assistant.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Eric Severson: Either as a participant or as a host, and then, how do you want to think about, uh, summaries, sharing them automatically?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and then the last piece is, how can you, uh, get at the transcript to make sure that if you need to do, you know, a careful deep dive on what was said 2 weeks ago, again, because I am.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Eric Severson: chronically bad at remembering the details of a meeting two weeks ago, and this just makes that… here's how to do that. You can do it inside of Zoom, or you take that transcript, drop it in.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Eric Severson: MS Copilot and ask the questions.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, Ernie for sure.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Caroline Walters: And then, um, who… anybody else you think, Sherri?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Sherri Twitty: Well, I… you know, Eric…

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Sherri Twitty: The team is familiar with Zoom because we actually used this before RingCentral when we whipped COVID.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Eric Severson: Uh-huh.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Sherri Twitty: But, um, as far as who's using it regularly right now, I don't really.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Sherri Twitty: You know, they haven't…

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Sherri Twitty: officially done the shift from RingCentral to Zoom, uh, internally for CSU.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Sherri Twitty: So, um, that I'm aware of, but, um…

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Sherri Twitty: But I don't mean, I don't really know of anybody who's using it regularly or other than Ernie.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Sherri Twitty: And, of course, myself, um…

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Eric Severson: Do your managers use Zoom to have management meetings with their teams?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Sherri Twitty: I don't know if they're using RingCentral or Zoom. I know, I mean, I think they're kind of using them interchangeably right now.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Sherri Twitty: Uh, I know Renee schedules hers on Zoom now, uh, but we… the instructions we got were, we're gonna be going to Zoom, you can use RingCentral until we do… we officially move to Zoom.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Sherri Twitty: Um, and so, I don't know who's using what specifically. I think probably Natalie does, Kim Smith, most of them are.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Sherri Twitty: Using Zoom.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Eric Severson: So, I would be happy to have a management meeting. Sorry, go ahead, Caroline.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Caroline Walters: Well, I would… I would…

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Caroline Walters: I was gonna say, I recommend, why don't we just do a training for anyone who is interested? Not a mandated training, but just, hey, as a college, we're moving.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Caroline Walters: to the Zoom Platform, be ready for the move.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Caroline Walters: you're doing an AI, you know, 411, um…

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Caroline Walters: Zoom.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, and I'll give it a little detail, because the people that I think would…

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Eric Severson: Benefit the most are managers, if they're having team meetings.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Eric Severson: And, Sherri, when your eyesight is clear, I'm happy to spend as much time as you would like on this stuff.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Eric Severson: But with the managers, then, for a team meeting.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Eric Severson: as a simple follow-up, this is gold, right? Then you can focus on being present in the meeting.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Eric Severson: You can make your agenda, and then you can focus on the conversation with each person. You don't have to wildly record or remember what everybody said.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Eric Severson: The end of that meeting, we can tune the summaries for.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Eric Severson: you know, what were the big ideas? What are the themes of this meeting and week? What are the things that we need to think about as a team to, uh…

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Eric Severson: to move forward on. And then you, Sherri, if you're looking forever interested in.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Sherri Twitty: Hey, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to get off. I'm… I'm sick. I'm gonna have to get off. I'll have to…

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Sherri Twitty: Talk to y'all later.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Eric Severson: No problem. I'm sorry to hear that.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Caroline Walters: Hi Sherri hope you feel better.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Eric Severson: So what I was gonna finish that thought, Caroline, is that for Sherri then, or anybody that's managing across a bunch of managers.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Eric Severson: Being able to take the summaries, and we can set up some… make this easy, but being able to take the summaries.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Eric Severson: So that her end of the week can include, what did I hear, what did my teams discuss.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Eric Severson: Thematically and specifically, and to pull all that together for a neat document at the end of every week, if they're having weekly team meetings.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Eric Severson: then this is one of those things that, you know, look, I manage tons of teams, and the hardest thing that I had a handle on across a large number of people.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Eric Severson: was getting the temperature. I didn't need to get lost in, you know, with 800 reps. I didn't need to get lost in some reps.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Eric Severson: you know, details at an individual school. I was looking for trends, patterns, and broader areas.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Eric Severson: AI is fantastic at that with transcripts. So if you have a weekly meeting across 6 of your managers.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Eric Severson: For them to take the time to roll up, uh, what happened in this from a thematic perspective or other things takes a ton of time, especially if they're bad writers, and especially if they're not taking great notes during the meeting they're trying to run.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Eric Severson: This makes that all go away. You can concentrate on your people and conversation.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Eric Severson: And then you can, you know, make that follow-up way different, and it's just a little bit of skill.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Eric Severson: around knowing that these capabilities are in Zoom, and then, you know, how long does it take to get that transcript out.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Eric Severson: Uh, to, you know, from your team meeting, and I'm pretty sure we can automate this. We might need to talk to Scott about turning some things on.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Eric Severson: Because everything is locked down in the MS Companion, but it is absolutely.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Eric Severson: manageable to say, I want to take the team meeting transcripts from these 6, I want to put it into a single place, I want the summary to come to Sherri.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Eric Severson: So that she sees just the high-level summary on the team meetings each week.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Eric Severson: Does that replace the weekly update stuff? No, probably not, but it gives you another data point.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Eric Severson: based on… I, as a field-based leader, I mandated.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Eric Severson: weekly meetings with teams, because when you're remote, I thought it was way too easy.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Eric Severson: For people to become isolated, and that's bad news, right? You want to make sure that you're bringing people together, lifting it up and supporting, but also getting.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Eric Severson: Meaningful information from a distributed organization is hard, and so we wrestled with this for years on.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Eric Severson: is it good use of management time to do all these calls and roll-ups, and we're not actually doing the work? I'm like, oh, the work?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Eric Severson: is to provide meaningful insight across the management layer so that you can think about it and have some unique insights. And these tools now.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Eric Severson: make that super possible. Um, so…

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Eric Severson: That's my pitch. If… if…

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Caroline Walters: Well, I turned mine on. You'll be getting summaries from me.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Eric Severson: Okay, good. Good. Yay.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Caroline Walters: Um, and have patience with Sherri she's not quite, she's not quite as transparent.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Eric Severson: No, no, I…

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Eric Severson: I get it. Well, so they're… yeah, yeah.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Caroline Walters: And so, it takes a little while. It's almost going to be probably some modeling from us.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Caroline Walters: Get her on board.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I mean, again, I've had clients that said to me, I don't want anything to do with this, I think it's the devil's work, to…

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Caroline Walters: And…

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Eric Severson: you're trying to replace me, to why in the world do you need to see my chit-chat comments? I'm like, I don't, and we'll work out the social bits, you know, get AI to focus on the meaningful bits, right? I don't care about your social stuff.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Eric Severson: Uh, let's just focus on the other. And then, yeah, so, I'm obviously a fan. Let me…

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Eric Severson: Do you have 5 more minutes I want to shift gears on.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Eric Severson: So, uh, we didn't really get a chance to talk about the, um…

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Eric Severson: The ideas that Tony, Dwayne, and I.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Eric Severson: We're putting forward about 2026.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Caroline Walters: By the way, I love this notebook, Elliom.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Eric Severson: Good, good.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Caroline Walters: Like, uh, yes.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, yeah, and the deeper I go in it, you can control it.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Eric Severson: at a very granular level, but it takes a little work, so I started.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Eric Severson: with Notebook LM in early 2024.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Eric Severson: and probably have 50 notebooks at this point, and I'm still climbing up the learning curve, right? So, as… but I am blown away by what you can do.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, okay.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Eric Severson: With a little bit of work, right? So, uh, and if you ever get stuck.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Eric Severson: I just, yesterday, or 2 days ago, found a website where you can drop an image in.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Eric Severson: from Notebook LM, and it will deconstruct it to a PowerPoint where you can edit everything. Yeah.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Eric Severson: Absolutely amazing. I was like…

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Caroline Walters: Uh, pass that my way, yes!

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I think that Google will build that in the notebook LM at some point, but today, if there's something that you don't like, but that, you know, you're stuck with this whole image, now there… I'll send you the link to that when we're done here.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Caroline Walters: Cool, yeah.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Eric Severson: So there… there are 3 things that… that I wanted to make sure that we hit for a minute, and it's…

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Eric Severson: It's really this first one. So these are the three priorities that I think we should have in business development for 2026.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Eric Severson: partnership development, channel optimization, which is really the benefit companies, and then, uh, operational infrastructure, which is really 3 things. The, you know, the soccer thing.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Eric Severson: Finishing off some playbooks and looking at ways to boost internal visibility and communication across our teams.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Eric Severson: But it's really partnership development that I wanted to talk about for a minute to see…

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Eric Severson: See what you think about this.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Eric Severson: So, um, because there's really just me and Tony doing this.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Eric Severson: And because there are so many people.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Eric Severson: across CSU that are doing MOUs and articulation agreements.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Eric Severson: I've been mulling over what's our role? What can we do that contributes the most?

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Eric Severson: I don't think it's, you know, Fortune 500, honestly. That was more about having a lot of people that could bang on it with a singular focus.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Eric Severson: I, um…

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Eric Severson: I think that…

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Eric Severson: we have the ability, Eric and Tony have the ability.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Eric Severson: To really help in the areas that are less well-known, that are new.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Eric Severson: and maybe a little unclear. And so, when I think about.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Eric Severson: That concept.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Eric Severson: It's not education.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Eric Severson: Could we help in education? Sure. Do you need us in education? I don't think so, because the education is extremely well understood, it's well organized, right? It structures.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Eric Severson: At every state and county level that are not hard to discern, and…

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Eric Severson: our offerings are… are not brand new. They're tried and true offerings, and so…

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Eric Severson: to penetrate the education marketplace, you need people. You need people on the education team with network connections, and frankly, your outreach team is probably extremely well-suited.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Eric Severson: To begin to build the relationships and the presence at those conferences, and then look for learning partnerships.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Eric Severson: be pretty standard. And so, maybe, when it starts to ebb over into custom curriculum, somebody calls us and says, hey, can you help us with this? But I'm not even sure that's the case.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Eric Severson: I start to think about healthcare and I think, okay, healthcare is also, it's not as easy as, um, education.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Eric Severson: But it's pretty clear, right? So there are major hospital organizations, it's commercial, there are some associations.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Eric Severson: It's not hard to figure out, takes a little bit of work, but it's more about the mass.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Eric Severson: ability to do it. So you've got a good product team, and you've got the outreach team starting to build those relationships through presence.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Eric Severson: So, I get the sense that Sherri didn't love the nurses. I'm telling you, we… I rolled out a specialized nursing sales force at Pearson.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Eric Severson: And I loved it. Uh, I love the nurses, we had so much fun with them over the years, we had… we did a big business with them, so…

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Eric Severson: It's not that I don't want to be part of healthcare, because I thought that that population is.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Eric Severson: Uh, super fun and, you know, you're doing good in the world, but she seems like she's got that.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Eric Severson: So, where Eric and Tony can be…

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Caroline Walters: Well, I will plug in now.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Caroline Walters: Sherri's not going to big hospital systems trying to get a partnership.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Caroline Walters: like, I think that's where you, your team could plug in.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Caroline Walters: At a much higher level.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Caroline Walters: Sherri gets in the weeds, and I'm trying to get her from staying in the weeds so much, because if… I mean, I know she would like to advance.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Caroline Walters: In leadership, but until she changes some of the things.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Eric Severson: Yep. Yep.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Caroline Walters: She's still acting very much as a manager of the team.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Eric Severson: Well, but the ANA thing is a pretty good indication that she…

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Eric Severson: has the ability. Now, you know.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Caroline Walters: Oh! She does have the ability! It's getting her to… to do it.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Eric Severson: Yes.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Caroline Walters: just like this thing, the opportunity that, uh, Bonnie.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Caroline Walters: emailed, you know, and Ken included me, and I sent to you guys.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Caroline Walters: In my mind, I feel like that's more you, because that's a very similar thing that you guys did, and if you don't want it, I mean, Sherri can do it.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Eric Severson: No, no, we'll get to that. This is exactly what I'm building up to, is that this is the trigger for… to have this conversation a little bit, and it's forced me to… there's been a couple of things that I've been.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Caroline Walters: But…

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Eric Severson: mulling over as I get to know the organization more. And the thing that sort of sticks out to me is.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Eric Severson: thank you for putting me on that MOU thing and the articulation thing. I had no idea that they were being signed like that.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and so I've really, you know, in a big corporation, that would never, you would never have this level of decentralization. You have a deal desk, and it all flows through the deal desk, but…

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Eric Severson: There's a lot more cost and revenue associated with those.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Eric Severson: partnerships in a big corporation, right? You're extracting money, and it's a whole different deal.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Eric Severson: These are not that complex. And so, I believe now that the decentralized thing is a.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Eric Severson: positive strength of CSU, and I'm trying to figure out how do I fit in with Tony to that, and how do we take advantage of that.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Eric Severson: Scale. To do a decentralized approach, but to do it a little better, right? Because I do…

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Eric Severson: So… so then, to… for our… for Tony and Eric for 26.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Eric Severson: Uh, new programs, like space. So space compared to education or nursing, it's less clear.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Eric Severson: There's not unifying central organization, there are very tight geography-specific stuff.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Eric Severson: There's not a list that you can go to anywhere to say, give me all these things, so it requires a little bit of research.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Eric Severson: And then everything requires some investment in building the relationship, the connection's there.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Eric Severson: I do think that Jim, Tony, Eric can help in the more difficult areas.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Eric Severson: Uh, so that and, you know, I've got skilled trades here, I definitely think that's worth.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Eric Severson: You know, us spending focused time on opening up the pipelines from all the various skilled trades into.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Eric Severson: CSU for both the hire, train, deploy model, which is that pre-employment thing, right, we'll pick up a little revenue there, but the real big gain.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Eric Severson: is working with the employers and establishing our brand, so as they start to think about degree attainment and management, you know, succession planning, management, staffing.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Eric Severson: We are a natural, uh, partner in all those things.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Eric Severson: Beyond that, it's… well, we have some relationships that are mostly around custom curriculum, and I think there, it does make sense for us to continue to focus. So that's live view.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Eric Severson: That's the energy consortium, that's Signal Mutual, right? We have a meeting with Richard, who, uh, tomorrow, who's the Signal Mutual guy.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Eric Severson: And, you know, we have not been keeping him up to speed with what's going on. I think he will be elated tomorrow, because we have been working while he's been absent or doing other things.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Eric Severson: And you know how that goes. When you're not involved, you wonder, is anybody working? You guys doing anything with this stuff?

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Eric Severson: So, I expect that to be a fun meeting, but the flip side of it is, we've still not registered any students in those courses.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Caroline Walters: Yes. What are we gonna do about that, Eric?

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Eric Severson: So…

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Eric Severson: Correct. That is… Tony and I had this conversation yesterday, saying.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Eric Severson: reach out to Richard, he had a 30-minute update to him, asked for another 30 minutes.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Eric Severson: And we will give him, you know, here are the start dates, here's our registration so far, there's zero. What can we do together to try to amp up our promotion?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Eric Severson: We're also going to show them the web… the landing page to say, listen, help us figure out what would you like to see on this landing page. I know, if I, you know.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Eric Severson: if he doesn't have ideas, we're going to put the courses there. The Signal Mutual landing page is super generic. There's no mention of the maritime safety curriculum at all. So, number one, gee, let's fix that.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Eric Severson: And then, you know, start to engage with, uh, with Sigma mutual head. So that, to me.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Eric Severson: Makes total sense and is something that 2 guys can focus on and do.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Eric Severson: then maintaining a strong local focus is kind of what Jim does, and Jim is going to do what Jim does. So, I think the best thing to do there is.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Eric Severson: lightly corral and guide, enable, and get out of the way. Let them go do that. If we were hiring.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Eric Severson: 200 reps, I would say, hmm, well, let's take that model and figure out.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Eric Severson: In major metro areas where we have great partnership potential to put that model in place, but that's not what we're doing, so Jim sort of.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Eric Severson: Jim. So then that gets to, what about everything else? And so, Tony is a good example of somebody who I think has been opportunistic and been event-based.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Eric Severson: that are outreach events, and so, you know, it's great that he has the Filipino Nursing Association thing.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Eric Severson: I don't know that we're doing anything with that, and I… yes.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Caroline Walters: We don't have a student with them.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, so this is where it gets real quiet when I asked Tony about what are we doing to activate these things. In 26, we have to start to.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Eric Severson: formulate a plan to activate post-MOU.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Caroline Walters: I'm gonna circle back to what we were saying about nursing, and you said Sherri has a firm hand on it.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Caroline Walters: Do you want Sherri just across the board to leave nursing efforts? We can pull… Tony was in there because no one else could go. Not because… I mean, it was like a last-minute thing. He went, and then he went again.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Eric Severson: Well, this is the question.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Caroline Walters: Tony's not locked into nursing.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Caroline Walters: Even though Bonnie dropped his name in that email she sent to Ken, that's not Bonnie's decision who's working.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Caroline Walters: Nursing events, that's between all of us, and I mean, I know.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Caroline Walters: Sherri has a lot of ownership in it, because it's a new program her reps are promoting, so if you want her to wrap.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Caroline Walters: totally around it. I don't think she'd have a problem with that at all.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Eric Severson: Well, I… I wanted… I wanted this question to come up, uh, because again, I think that considerations are two.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Eric Severson: One, how do we work with this decentralized approach that I think plays to the CSU strengths? I think that's good, right?

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and then, how do we make the most out of the Eric and Tony?

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Eric Severson: Uh, investment. And I think that, you know, again, I think it can be a little bit more focused.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Eric Severson: On areas that are difficult, that we're not already, you know, down the road of.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Eric Severson: And then along with that comes, you know, we're going to continue to look at.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Eric Severson: What can we do on the amplification perspective, right? Like this Orlando thing.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Eric Severson: This Orlando thing's a great example, similar to the nursing. So I'm definitely open to the nursing, and I've had this conversation, and Tony doesn't want to let go of the Filipino thing, because he's had some success there, but I don't think that's the right question. I think the way that you just put it is the right question.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Eric Severson: I think the extension of that might be with the Orlando Soccer Club.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Eric Severson: So, it depends on those partners. I took a quick scan at those partners.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Eric Severson: And I don't know that those are partners that we would put in a high-value list.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Eric Severson: Right?

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Caroline Walters: I think the main one is that Orlando Health.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Eric Severson: I agree. And in that case, but let's look at all of them. We need to… we need to be a little… we need to put industry identifiers on them, and I'll do this. I'm already down the road of a TAF done, right? Well, that's what I was doing during this meeting, was looking at that.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, mhm.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Eric Severson: And thinking about, if…

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Eric Severson: the main benefit to CSU is partnership with healthcare, then it may not be me at all. Then it might be Sherri.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Eric Severson: And that should go and work these things now. I assume Sherri's got the skills to do that, and so, you know, to work those things, and I think then.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Eric Severson: Think that plays to our strengths.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Eric Severson: The 2 other thoughts I had about this is, one is kind of tactical. I definitely think.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Eric Severson: Now that I'm seeing all these articulation agreements, and I know you mentioned that there's been an attempt to clean this up.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Eric Severson: I think it is confusing and probably unhealthy that we have articulation agreements.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Eric Severson: True articulation agreement is just credit transfer for a designated set of things, but they have marketing stuff that starts to slip in there. So you've got articulation.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Eric Severson: That… that leaks over into custom curriculum and in the promotion.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Eric Severson: I… I, if I could wave a wand, would say.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Eric Severson: No more articulation agreements, it's a module that is… that fits into an MOU.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Eric Severson: that is a component of it. And so, you may have pure articulation, which is credit transfer. You may have custom curriculum, which shouldn't be called articulation, that should be called custom curriculum.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Eric Severson: And then you have the promotion and marketing agreements in exchange for the discount.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Eric Severson: Now we have two competing documents, and even within that articulation agreement, I see.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Eric Severson: the marketing stuff and the custom curriculum ebbing over is just sloppy. It's messy and it's confusing internally and externally.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Eric Severson: I… if you need to go to Ken to say, here's something that we should fix, right? This is one of those things where I would say.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Eric Severson: Clean… someone should clean that up, so that it's modules, and then the extension of that is.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Eric Severson: It would be great to explain to the organization the way that we are.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Eric Severson: focused for 26. I sat with…

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Eric Severson: uh, Tamara and her team and Tony, and they absolutely have no idea what he does. So they absolutely think he is Sherri. Sherri would probably get her back up fiercely about the amount of time that they are asking him.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Eric Severson: for help and directions with basic outreach. And I get that everybody does everything, but there's a level of clarity that if we can get to an agreement on, then I think is smart to help the.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Eric Severson: Uh, academic side of the house really understand it.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Caroline Walters: What really aggravates me…

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Caroline Walters: Is that they call our department outreach.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Eric Severson: Oh yeah, oh yeah, they…

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Caroline Walters: Holistically, and that's not who we are, and I am continuously.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Caroline Walters: saying, university relations, business development, corporate outreach, right?

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Caroline Walters: And so that… that's been going on for years, Eric. Years.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Caroline Walters: And, um, probably one of the reasons they think Tony is outreach is because a lot of the times he's acting as an outreach rep, not a true business development individual. And that's something we've got to move him, I think, to more of a BB role, as opposed to that outreach, like we talked about.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Caroline Walters: Tony doesn't need to be working those nursing events as a rep.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Eric Severson: We've talked about this, and I mean, this week we had the conversation about.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Caroline Walters: I gotcha.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Eric Severson: And it was really me…

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Eric Severson: floating this conversation about role clarity, and I've been trying to make up my own mind on this, Caroline as I… the two things that really helped me.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Eric Severson: Was seeing, frankly, the flow of all the agreements.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Eric Severson: And just looking at those, reading them, and thinking about, who are these coming from, and how's… this is…

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Eric Severson: This is aggressively decentralized.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:33.000
Caroline Walters: So let me give you a little history, real quick, okay? Before Dana Fuller was doing whatever she's doing with articulations.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Eric Severson: Then…

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Eric Severson: Yep. Yep.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Caroline Walters: we weren't getting… this wasn't happening at this rate. I mean, I think they're cold calling people, I don't know what they're doing, we've asked them, they won't tell us.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Caroline Walters: And inevitably, they signed, ooh, we got an articulation agreement with someone we've been partners with since 2009.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Caroline Walters: So, there's a lot of mess there.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Caroline Walters: Janelle will never not call it articulations, because that's the.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Caroline Walters: academic term, even though they're doing more than articulations, right? So.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Caroline Walters: The only reason that we're all in this together is because before even Janelle, I think, came on board, Joe Manjone was over Articulations, and he came to us saying, could we put the partnership as part of Articulations?

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Caroline Walters: Yes, we can do that, Dr. Joe. And then, it got totally handed to us.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Caroline Walters: Because the majority of articulations were with, like, EMS training centers. It wasn't.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Caroline Walters: Purely… it was like their training credit articulated into course credit.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Eric Severson: It's transfer credit. Sure, it's transfer credit.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Caroline Walters: Yes, transfer credit, like that. Um…

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Caroline Walters: I don't ever see it being separate, because that… we had it separate. It caused a lot of confusion, because Dana would talk to people, and then we'd try to present them with the MOU from our side. Well, I've already signed a document.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Caroline Walters: I think that the one thing that may…

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Caroline Walters: We may can make happen is to say, we would like to add an addendum, another section to the articulation that addresses marketing.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Caroline Walters: How we want to market to these people.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Caroline Walters: Um, because basically, guess what? They're not doing anything, Eric. After they get the articulation.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Caroline Walters: They're not servicing them.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Eric Severson: So, can we…

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Eric Severson: pull performance data on schools that have an articulation but not an MOU?

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Caroline Walters: Oh, I… yeah, I can tell you right now! Just a second.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Eric Severson: So how… is that in Power BI? How do you do that?

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Caroline Walters: Yes! Yeah.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Eric Severson: And is it… and how do you differentiate between a partner that is an MOU versus an articulation?

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Caroline Walters: If it comes in as an articulation, well, there's a drop-down in Omega where you click articulation if they have an articulation with us.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Eric Severson: And is that… does that drop down in Power BI?

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Eric Severson: It is, okay.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, hold on, I'm gonna pull up articulations. I was just looking at them. This is for 20…

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Caroline Walters: 25…

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Caroline Walters: and of course, you know, on Power BI, I'm only seeing the active articulations, so…

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Caroline Walters: Of all the articulations in Omega, whatever that number is, only 28.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Caroline Walters: Have a student in, um…

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Caroline Walters: That means a total number of 131 students used in articulation.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Caroline Walters: The 10% discount that comes with an articulation.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Caroline Walters: for their coursework, and 71 of the 131 were from Sophia Learning.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Eric Severson: So, they get the 10% discount, but how many of them get a transfer credit? All of them in that articulation?

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Eric Severson: Group?

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Caroline Walters: I mean, I think you'd have to look at that individually. It depends on what they're transferring in, and if it's credible.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Eric Severson: So…

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Eric Severson: I know that…

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Caroline Walters: Let me ask you a question. Why are you worried about articulation so much?

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Eric Severson: Um…

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Eric Severson: I think it adds to the confusion. So there's two things that have friction that I'm struggling with. One is…

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Eric Severson: uh… the organization sees outreach, that's the visible part of the organization, so they treat the entire organization as outreach, right? They're not clear.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Eric Severson: On who does what.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Eric Severson: the… that's number one. Number two…

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Eric Severson: It it's just…

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Eric Severson: A big organization would never allow this to happen, where you've got conflicting, overlapping, aligning agreements floating around out there. It just…

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Eric Severson: bad practice, right? And so, then for me.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Eric Severson: Uh, if you look up the definition of articulation, that is not what is happening in those agreements.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Caroline Walters: I understand, but Eric, that is not gonna change. But you just… I need you to accept that this just… I realize big organizations wouldn't run this way, but.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Caroline Walters: Ken Styren is not going to go against Janelle on what she wants to do with articulation and what her team is doing.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Eric Severson: So, the thing that might…

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Caroline Walters: I don't want you to waste a lot of energy on this, because this is… this is not a sword to fall on.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Caroline Walters: This is not… I mean…

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Caroline Walters: Our team doesn't worry about articulations. If we are with a partner who is interested in transfer credit, we then connect them to… well, the outreach reps connect them to Sherri.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Caroline Walters: Sherri connects them to Dana to start that whole conversation.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, so there, I guess, the…

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Eric Severson: The problem that I think is worth solving is two here.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Eric Severson: I'm not… I don't want to just clean it up to have it cleaned up, although that… my OCD tendencies are definitely tweaked on stuff like this, but…

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Eric Severson: I wonder, does anybody know whether the ROI articulation.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Eric Severson: Is where it should be.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Caroline Walters: Oh, well, yes, Ken Styren's very aware, because I have shared this data with him.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Eric Severson: Okay, so I also, when you… when you gave me those numbers, my first thought would be…

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Eric Severson: Holy cow, we are under leveraging the idea of articulation.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Eric Severson: Right? And so, uh, if we're signing them and nothing is happening, something's wrong, right? We should be able to…

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Eric Severson: the concept of credit transfer is… should be a way to encourage more enrollment than what I'm hearing.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Eric Severson: It is… yeah.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Caroline Walters: Okay, listen, listen.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Caroline Walters: This is not our department.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:51.000
Caroline Walters: I don't want you worried about articulations. I need you worrying about business development.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Eric Severson: Okay, okay.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Caroline Walters: Signal Mutual?

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Eric Severson: So, they're similar in that…

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Eric Severson: It all is gonna come down to a couple of things.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Eric Severson: The big gap on all of this is they sign the paper and they think it's done and nothing is done, right? Same with the MOUs.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Eric Severson: Signal Mutual, we're living it. I'm trying not to get pissed with me, Tony, and Richard, because we say the words, and then it doesn't dissolve into work that drives outcomes, and I've never seen that before.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Eric Severson: Now, there is a small dependency to marketing, which we have got to continue to wrestle with.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Eric Severson: But, you know, it is taking a stupid amount of my time for 4 courses that are a custom course amount to go, what the do we have to do to actually see success here?

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Eric Severson: We've got the courses created. It's a good idea. It makes the world a better or safer place.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Eric Severson: And yet, there's crickets. It's silence. There's no buts in seats, there's no even registration, so…

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Eric Severson: This is the big gap across all of business development, across all of articulations that I see, is.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Eric Severson: You're signing paper, but so what? If it doesn't devolve into a pipeline of students, the work doesn't devolve into work that creates a pipeline of students.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Eric Severson: who cares? And then it's confusing when I'm starting to work with clients that have custom curriculum, they may… it probably makes sense for us to look, we're doing custom curriculum.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Eric Severson: there should be an articulation baked into that, right? I mean, that's part of the pathway. So, 75-page PDF from Larry the Welder.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Eric Severson: should count for something. Let's… and then, so these things all come together, and I think of them as modular. If you don't want me to go and have the conversations with academics, that's fine.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Eric Severson: Uh, but then we're gonna continue to stew in a, what the does University Relations actually do? It's just outreach. They're the nice people that go to the conferences.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Eric Severson: and man the booth, and we wish they had better materials. Marketing sucks. That's where you're going to be stuck with academics, unless we start.

00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Eric Severson: Well, again, I will take your lead on this whole thing. I'm focused on Signal Mutual, believe me, that is where the focus is, because right after that is LiveView, and right after that is CTR.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Eric Severson: the custom curriculum part of CTR. Signal Mutual, I'm focused on the most simple thing, which is, wow, we've got the stuff written, custom curriculum's out there, now what do we do to drive success within that?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and we can just leave it at that, um, and as we involve the MOU to include an articulation piece.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Eric Severson: Because I think they're all wrapped up in that same, you know, thing that gives people motivation to come to CSU.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Caroline Walters: What I would like for us to do… I know you and Tony met with Misty on the one opportunity, right? The… is it live view?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Eric Severson: CTR. CTR.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Caroline Walters: Or the other CTR.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Caroline Walters: I want to have a meeting with Janelle, myself, Misty, and you.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Caroline Walters: And I want them to tell us this is the direction they support you going in.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Eric Severson: Oh, they do! Well, I'm sure.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Caroline Walters: It's one thing to have one or two, but if your whole direction in 2026 is pre-employment.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Caroline Walters: and you keep giving the welding example, I need them on board. I can't just sign off on, this is… yes, go for it, until we're in a meeting, and I hear it.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Caroline Walters: that this is Janelle. I mean, it's one thing to bring them an opportunity, it's a different thing to say, this is our initiative for 26.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Eric Severson: Sure. Yep, yep.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Eric Severson: It's not just that. It's one part of, uh, under partnership development.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Eric Severson: it is a portion of this. So, like, the NCCR thing, we should deliver that. That's going to be more traditional. Could be custom curriculum, it might not be.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Eric Severson: I think Lincoln Tech, I'm having conversations with their COO pretty soon about the same sort of.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Eric Severson: uh, agreements, right? Learning partner agreements just focused in the skilled trades area. So it's definitely not the only thing we're focusing on, and it's not even, you know.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Eric Severson: I don't know what percentage of our time right now is getting sucked up onto this, but I think that… and I have… I went over and have met with them, both Misty and with.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Eric Severson: Janelle, just to take the temperature, to say, hey, I think there's opportunity here, are you supportive? So, uh…

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Caroline Walters: Hey, listen, man, I need you to loop me in on these meetings. This is really not looking good when you're doing this.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Eric Severson: I agree.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Eric Severson: Well, if these were me walking around…

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Eric Severson: Sure. This is me walking around on Friday. So, one of the things that I learned years ago.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Eric Severson: working with academic institutions, show up at the door, see what happens, right? I could have asked you to come with me, I don't think you would have enjoyed it, because I spent an hour walking the halls, waiting for people to be available, right? So…

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Caroline Walters: So, to me, that's different than a meeting. Walking the halls and mentioning something is a different thing than a meeting, and you will find people are going to be, oh yeah, that's a great idea.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, okay.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Eric Severson: Fair, fair. So we can have the meeting, and if you want to set it up, that'd be totally great, but I just want to make sure you understand.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Caroline Walters: Oh, yes.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Caroline Walters: Yes.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Eric Severson: it is a focus, it is not the focus. It is… skilled trades is an area to open up through traditional learning partnerships.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Eric Severson: Uh, through some non-traditional ones, and that there is this interesting piece that could take a disproportionate amount of time, because it's brand new, right? This is that.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Caroline Walters: Hmm.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Eric Severson: hire, train, deploy model, this is brand new. And so, yeah, we might spend a little bit more time there, but that's not the only focus.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Eric Severson: Then the other one is cultivating the high potential targeted partners. So…

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Eric Severson: energy, aerospace, uh, space in general, uh, looking at where can we continue to build out the live view stuff.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Eric Severson: Those are the areas. What's in here, but I wanted to debate a little bit, is healthcare.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and so as we continue to talk about this, and I think maybe the soccer thing is a good test pilot for that, let me get you and Sherri a list of their existing learning partners.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Eric Severson: And then we have this conversation again. If the primary B2B goal.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Eric Severson: is healthcare. I'm happy to be involved, but I'm also happy to let Sherri own the whole thing, and I've had this conversation with.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Eric Severson: Tony, and he will let go of the Filipino Nurses Association, right? Uh, I think that's a way for us to figure out how do we play to the strengths of the distributed nature of this.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Eric Severson: uh, ability to sign learning partners, which is great, I think it's clarity, but then the more important contribution is.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Eric Severson: What do we do to make them productive learning partners, right? That's the more important part.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Caroline Walters: Yes.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Caroline Walters: And then, I would also add a third thing, or maybe a fourth thing to that.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Caroline Walters: Uh, is… let's evaluate who we have and how we can.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Caroline Walters: elevate them. What partners can we identify that we want to move them to a next level of engagement?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Eric Severson: So…

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Caroline Walters: and I'm not talking about Orange Beach Fire, like, from your perspective, a high level, a high level.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Eric Severson: Yes.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Caroline Walters: partner that we're seeing, you know, we're evaluating to see.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Caroline Walters: If we… is there anything more we might can do?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Eric Severson: Totally agree with that, and I think some of that is numbers, and then some of that is looking at, do we have.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Eric Severson: an advocate. So, Signal Mutual stands out because they've got Richard. He's a great advocate.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Eric Severson: And if we don't have a great advocate, let's figure out, you know, is… how do we… what do we do about that? How do we start to develop that advocate?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Eric Severson: I'm also talking to Tony a ton about, I don't think it makes sense for us to be at all of the traditional.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Eric Severson: outreach events. We might go to one or two where we see that it aligns to or is adjacent to us, or if they need extra help, I'm fine with that, but.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Eric Severson: you know, I said to him, I don't know that we need to do any fire, or police, or… and he got a little starchy about the police because of the axon thing.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Eric Severson: And so, we're still, you know, having these conversations about where we see our time being focused.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Eric Severson: The fire was a big thing for him to chew on for a while, and I'm like, look, I know that this is a central part of the CSU success story.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Eric Severson: But there's two of us, and if we're going to carve out a clear space.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Eric Severson: I don't know that they need us. Yes, we could go and sign, you know, learning partnerships with municipalities that aren't in there already, but that feels like a…

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Eric Severson: Again, outreach, if they want to do that, that's outreach should do that, and figure out how to do it as an adjacent meeting to.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Eric Severson: Conference or in their non-conference time or elsewhere because it's so well known.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Eric Severson: Um, so…

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Caroline Walters: No, I like that, Eric. I mean, there's no need… we need to divide and conquer.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Caroline Walters: You have a very small team. He doesn't need to… y'all… y'all don't have to have a touch on every single program.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Caroline Walters: Safety and fire…

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Caroline Walters: We're the leaders.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Caroline Walters: You know, in those areas. Now, safety, I do think there's opportunity with maybe some larger companies.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Eric Severson: Yes. Yes, totally agree.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Caroline Walters: But I don't know that that's gonna happen on an expo floor.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, so I'm open to that a little bit, because again, uh, I don't know for a fact, and safety is the point of entry to so many different organizations.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Eric Severson: That, and I… and that was… kept Tony calm. He was… you know, he doesn't get upset, but he was… definitely raised eyebrows on the no-fire thing.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Eric Severson: And a no healthcare thing as a concept. And again, I don't want to sit here and just make all these decisions without your input, without his input, figuring out, do we agree? Because if we don't agree, there's no point, right? We need to be aligned on.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Eric Severson: On this stuff, so…

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Caroline Walters: Well, I just think, too, like, on some of the…

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Caroline Walters: Bigger conferences.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Caroline Walters: I think we've gotten to a point at some… at some of them, we just have too many people.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Caroline Walters: We don't need everybody that's there. If y'all want to come, you certainly know whatever you want to do, I'm fine with, right? Like, I think you should come to FDIC, because you've never been.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I…

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Caroline Walters: And that is the largest conference that we do. So…

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Eric Severson: Totally agree.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Caroline Walters: I think you should be there, whether you want Tony to come, I'm leaving that up to you. It doesn't matter to me.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Caroline Walters: You know, however you want to handle that. But I like the priorities that you have, um, on here. I think those are good.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Caroline Walters: I like the fact and, um, Sherri being the lead of nursing because she's very passionate.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Caroline Walters: you know, she's very passionate about that. And, um…

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Caroline Walters: And I like this slide a lot, too. This is good. And I may want to use this, because in March, we have our marketing committee meeting, so I will be sharing the strategies.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Caroline Walters: of our team, and so this would be great, and then I'll probably work on.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Caroline Walters: Some for… like, a slide for each department would be ideal. Community alumni?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Caroline Walters: Sherri's team, that kind of stuff, so…

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Eric Severson: Well, put all your documents in Notebook LM, and then if you need help with prompting, I'll help you with prompting.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Eric Severson: Um, let's talk about the conference request. So…

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Eric Severson: The… uh… this is my follow-up look for the…

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Eric Severson: CLO. And I'm still working that, and I'm of two minds about this.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Caroline Walters: Hmm.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Eric Severson: The immediate ROI isn't there. It's the opportunity to build the relationship.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Eric Severson: Which you don't really do during speed dating, right?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Caroline Walters: Right.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Eric Severson: So you get an opportunity for them to respond to your follow-up, not all do.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Eric Severson: And so, that's what you get.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Eric Severson: Of the population that are at these things.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Eric Severson: I'd say.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Eric Severson: 15% are there for a boondoggle. They could give a less, and they're not paying attention to whatever anybody says. They have to sit there because that's how they got their free trip to a resort paid for.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Eric Severson: I looked at the one for nursing, and I thought.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Eric Severson: CNOs are… tend to be a little more serious people, and again, I have 5 years of, uh, managing a dedicated sales organization inside of the nursing, uh, thing at Pearson, so…

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Eric Severson: We did events with those guys. They're a little more serious, they're not your party nurses, for sure.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and so, maybe. They're also probably a little more difficult to build relationships with. If Bonnie.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Eric Severson: What Tony and Eric didn't have…

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Eric Severson: Was any brand presence with this group, or any that the chief learning officers.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Eric Severson: or any particular awareness, right? To a VP and a director, nobody really cared, right? It was, uh, who are these guys? We're doing this because we… this is how we get our free meal in our fancy hotels.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Eric Severson: the message stuck a little bit, but it's speed dating. If you've ever seen speed dating, you're having 10 meetings, you know, in a.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Eric Severson: day, your powers of recolla… there's no AI transcript, your powers of recollection are miniscule.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Eric Severson: What might be different about the nursing is if Bonnekum is well known and understood and recognized, that might be different.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Eric Severson: Uh, if CSU solves a very specific problem that resonates strongly with the CNOs, the chief learning officers have a.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Eric Severson: Breath this wide, right? So, we… we connected with 2 or 3.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Eric Severson: Not 24.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Eric Severson: Uh, then it might be a little different. And then the last thing, I think Sherri made this point.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Eric Severson: I don't… you know, we spent $24,000, and…

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Eric Severson: I don't know that I would spend more than that for a single event. I would go, and I looked at that event company, they do events across the board, which means they're not specialized in any one area.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Eric Severson: And so I'd be cautious about the price point of that one to go, well, we'd like to participate. What other menu options? Is there a $10,000 menu option that you have?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Caroline Walters: Right.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and then I would send, uh, Sherri and, and Bonnie.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, I looked at the agenda, or the sample agenda. There's only 3.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Caroline Walters: one-on-one meeting slots. There's, like, an… there's two hours, like a 10.30 to 1230 one-on-one meetings, a…

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Caroline Walters: In the evening, the one-on-one meetings, and then the next day, the next morning.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Caroline Walters: And… Eric, is it right that you pretty much request who you'd like to meet with, and then they pair you up?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Caroline Walters: As to who the people who are actually attending want to meet with?

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, so there's a requirement for the attendees who are there for free, right? And it's always at a beautiful place, and so…

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Eric Severson: They have to have a certain number of meetings. So, and there's a request and an approval process. As a participant, you request, these are the groups that we want to meet with.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Eric Severson: Uh, some say, no, I have no interest. A few will put you in because they actually want to talk to you, and then the most are you're in there because.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Eric Severson: they have to have their dance card filled, and that looks like it might not be super painful, right? Do I want to meet with those nice education folks, or I don't want to have another, you know, high-tension.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Caroline Walters: Yes.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Eric Severson: brain blowout with people selling a plastic widget. No, I don't want to deal with the sellers of the plastic widget.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Eric Severson: Is it a little, that's what CLO was. Is it a little different for nursing? Maybe, maybe. So I would tend to be supportive at a lower price point and look at that, and then.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Eric Severson: You know, and then for Sherri it would be, have you ever done one of these? If you've never done one of these, then withhold judgment. Don't get shitty about 75,000 ways to spend the money differently.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah. He hasn't.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Eric Severson: you don't know, because you haven't done it. Go do it, put your head and heart in it, go with Bonnie. If nothing else, you're going to spend time with Bonnie.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Caroline Walters: Right.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Eric Severson: that seems fantastic. Uh, maybe not at 75 grand, but I bet there's…

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, well, we don't have the funds to do $75,000. I mean, we just didn't budget for it.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Eric Severson: Oh, it's our money, it's not Bonnie's money. It would be, uh…

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Caroline Walters: No! They're wanting us to pay for it!

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Eric Severson: Oh, I'd go back and say, how about we split it, and let's do a lower price point, see what they say.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Caroline Walters: Um… yeah.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Caroline Walters: Well, since you explained that perfectly, will you use your AI magic and summarize that? And I'm gonna…

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Eric Severson: Yes, I will.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Caroline Walters: Then I'll put my little two cents to it to an email, and that will be a great response to.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Eric Severson: Perfect.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Caroline Walters: Because that way we're speaking to the experience that we've had and, you know, that kind of good stuff.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Caroline Walters: And, from what I have…

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Caroline Walters: I haven't personally experienced it, but from what I've been told via Sherri, I mean, Bonnie always asks for the absolute highest sponsorship, the highest opportunity.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000
Caroline Walters: And we just can't do it for every event. I'm quite sure Sherri could reach out to these people and say, hey, what are the opportunities?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, she should, because again.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Eric Severson: I… we could have brought 2 more people, and it would have been a waste of time. 2 people is all you need.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Eric Severson: And then…

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Eric Severson: I would, you know, uh… so, I used granola, and I took it on my phone, because there's nothing that we have at CSU for this.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Eric Severson: And I recorded every one of our one-on-ones because when you do 10 in one day.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Eric Severson: nobody remembers anything, right? You see the people at cocktails, you smile, you look at your name tag, and you struggle to remember.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Eric Severson: what are we talking about? Did we have a good connection? Is there anything for me to build on, or are we just gonna chit-chat about the environment, see if we can have fun together, and…

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Eric Severson: Go from there. Uh, and frankly, Tony's best relationship came from.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Eric Severson: Our icebreaker, he sat next to a guy, they paired us up, and he got paired up with the guy.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and they had fun in their icebreaker, and so that's our number one best follow-up connection.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Eric Severson: which we still haven't gotten into a learning partnership, but the guy responds to Tony, because they had a great time at that intro thing. So…

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Caroline Walters: Oh, and by the way, I think you and Sherri must have been texting, because the woman brought up our partnership with Orlando and said she wants to get it signed before they would do the press release.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Caroline Walters: So, and then you… then you came on and said, and I'm like, he didn't hear what she said, so…

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Eric Severson: Well, great!

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Eric Severson: I did not. I did not. I'm sorry that I missed that. I would have just said, let me shut up and yes, let's do that. So…

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Caroline Walters: They are going to…

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Caroline Walters: That's okay. They're gonna…

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Caroline Walters: They're gonna schedule a meeting with the two of us.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Eric Severson: Fantastic. Fantastic.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Caroline Walters: And then that way. So that's gonna happen.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, the MLS has learning partnerships, but there's no reason that we can't, uh, put one in place with the local Orlando club, and…

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Eric Severson: Um, yay for that. Yay. Okay.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, and I'd love to have a chance to go talk to the team, well, especially the women's team.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Eric Severson: Sure, absolutely. Or…

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.000
Caroline Walters: you know, that's… just a personal thing, I think would be cool to be able to…

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. Heck yeah.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Caroline Walters: do that, you know. Um, okay, so we talked about…

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Caroline Walters: The nursing thing…

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Caroline Walters: Um, I had a note to set a meeting with Dale about Orlando. Do we still need to do that, or we, uh… because what I heard in that meeting, that Brett Patterson would be the person communicating with them on our behalf.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Eric Severson: I don't think so.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Eric Severson: Well, so the big deliverable that I… that I thought I heard was…

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Eric Severson: we are on the hook for getting the distribution of 1,000 tickets, and that Brett would be figuring that out. That's what I thought I heard.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Caroline Walters: What that actually means is that he will reach out to us, primarily Sherri with the smaller learning partners in the area, and then you, if there are larger ones, like the space people, for targeting some people.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Caroline Walters: So it'll be a combination of…

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Caroline Walters: You two figuring out who do we want to offer these tickets to.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. And when I looked at…

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Caroline Walters: But then, I think that's not till September, so we… we're… we've got plenty of time.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Eric Severson: You know, when I looked at the…

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Caroline Walters: On that deal.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Eric Severson: Salesforce by mileage buckets.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Eric Severson: What stuck out to me in both the target and the existing.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Eric Severson: Is that we need to really look at getting…

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Eric Severson: more aerospace companies identified and targeted in there because I looked at that whole thing and there was a point where I was like, well.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Eric Severson: If we agree that Tony and Eric should be focused on.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Eric Severson: You know, space, and new things.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Eric Severson: then the majority of this, from a B2B, really is gonna… also, how far would you drive for a soccer match?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Caroline Walters: Oh, you're asking the wrong person.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Eric Severson: No, I'm asking the right person, because most of the people that we're going to reach out to.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Eric Severson: are like you and me. I wouldn't drive 30 minutes for a free ticket to an MLS game here in Phoenix, and I would be like.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, maybe. I think I'm gonna watch Stranger Things tonight, so no.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, um, I… I haven't driven to an event we've had with the Pensacola baseball team.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Eric Severson: So…

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Eric Severson: So, the point of…

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Caroline Walters: Like, that is no interest to me at all!

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Eric Severson: Well, yeah, so the point that I was trying to… was mulling over with that is…

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Eric Severson: We have no relationships at all with these new aerospace companies.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Eric Severson: We have relationships with fire, police, municipalities that are education.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Eric Severson: that are close to the stadium. So, from a realistic perspective of.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Eric Severson: Who can we drive to the stadium? It's going to be existing and potential learning partners that are extremely close.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Eric Severson: And maybe a ticket would be… a $35 ticket would be something that they would find motivating. So they're not getting paid a lot, so that's…

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Eric Severson: Fire, police, EMS, education, education.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Eric Severson: But all of that then says to me, get out of the way and let Sherri do it, right? Because these are the tried and true areas. So, if you look at that spreadsheet with the mileage buckets, that's really when it started to stick out to me to go.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Eric Severson: You know, I wouldn't go 30 minutes for a game. I'm gonna be trying to get executives from aerospace.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:57.000
Eric Severson: to come there. If they're outside of a 30-minute drive, they've never met us, they don't know who we are, they've never heard of CSU.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Eric Severson: I don't know that we should PIN a lot of hopes to that, especially if.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-mm.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Eric Severson: school teachers might be a way better target area, because you know there are schools everywhere, right? There are schools and fire departments and police departments everywhere, so…

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Eric Severson: it may be the benefit of CSU to really look at that strategy, and I'll try to help you with that. I mean, the, uh…

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Eric Severson: Spreadsheet with the…

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Eric Severson: mileage buckets is where I started looking at that, going, huh, this might really.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Eric Severson: Be the primary focus that we should take in trying to drive, uh, attendance to these things.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, I don't think executives are gonna come. People we don't even know.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Eric Severson: Right.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Caroline Walters: They have no reason to, so that makes… I'm 100% on board with what you're thinking.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Eric Severson: A free ticket.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Eric Severson: So that, that then goes to…

01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Caroline Walters: Okay, here's a sidebar, sidebar for you. On your, um, chart, there's a misspelled word. So, segmenting audiences on benefit platforms.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Caroline Walters: It says, Targeting K Industries, not key.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Eric Severson: Oh, look at that. Good for you.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Caroline Walters: I don't know why I saw that, but I thought you would want to know, in case you were sending this to somebody else.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Eric Severson: No, no, this is internal, but it's still embarrassing, so I will drop this in the, uh, in the website, and I'll send you the link to the website, see if I can't fix that, because that…

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Eric Severson: This is a… when you do the selections for the slides, this is a detailed slide, and they're…

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Eric Severson: spelling errors that sneak into the detailed slides. If you stay with the middle section or the sparse section, there's way less text.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Eric Severson: This, to me, was a strategy that I started using at Pearson years ago, where if I could get one slide.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Eric Severson: That was busy, but that I could put up on a screen and talk to, you know, again, I was talking to 1,500 people for an hour.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Eric Severson: about, uh, about Pearson business and strategies, I found that I could tell the stories if I had triggers. Now.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Eric Severson: there's more words here than I would actually need, and I saw this from Mark Benioff, who's the CEO of Salesforce, does this. When he does his.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Eric Severson: big presentations. He throws up one slide that's busy, and then he talks, and he tells people, he narrates the slide.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Eric Severson: as memory triggers. So he's got the… all these little bubbles up there, and then he talks about it, tells the story, and then he'll even go, now, where was I? Oh yeah, we're on bubble number 2 from the left, now we're gonna talk about this. And I thought.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Eric Severson: That's fantastic. I used to spend weeks memorizing an hour-long presentation, so I didn't have to talk from notes.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Eric Severson: Uh, which is, you know, a key to engaging people, is not reading from notes.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and that's what this is for, but appreciate the spelling error, that's the thing you gotta worry about with AI, so…

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Caroline Walters: And then another thing I wanted to mention to you, Eric, is, um…

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Caroline Walters: Ken sent the senior execs an email this week, and it's time for his evaluation and assessment from the Board of Trustees.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Caroline Walters: And so, he was asking for… and they've redone the rubric to which they're scoring him by.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Caroline Walters: And so, he was asking for our help on providing him supporting information about wins for CSU, specifically from our department. So on there, there was a section about partnerships.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Eric Severson: Mm-hmm.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Caroline Walters: And, I mean, I have the stuff that you have submitted to me, you know, the high-level points from 25, all that.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Caroline Walters: which I can take and attempt to do this in Notebook LM, but…

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Eric Severson: Happy to do it. Yep.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Caroline Walters: Do you want to… do you want to do it? And…

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
Eric Severson: Happy to help you. Yep, we'll do it.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Caroline Walters: That'd be great, because this is… anything we can do to help Ken, I think, would be great. So, what I think he would need… I mean, I want to provide him something like this for $25, but then we probably need, you know, just some verbiage.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Eric Severson: Mm-hmm.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Caroline Walters: for him to support that image. So, um, do you mind helping me with that?

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Eric Severson: Sure, yeah, yeah. Um, so the things that would stick out in my head that are signed and done.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Caroline Walters: Correct.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Eric Severson: live view technology and Signal Mutual with CTR, right? So we can go into the…

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Eric Severson: Those are two areas that are, uh, that are worth making sure to call out.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Eric Severson: We've got a lot of stuff that's gonna happen, right? The, uh…

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Eric Severson: the other Skilled Trades Pathways, but they're not done, and they weren't done in 2025. But LiveView and Signal were.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Caroline Walters: So I'm thinking, like, with that… with that live view, maybe give some context of what's the revenue opportunity.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Eric Severson: Is there anything else?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Caroline Walters: Like, how is this really moving.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Eric Severson: the needle.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Caroline Walters: Deepening us forward. Yeah.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Caroline Walters: And even put yourself in there that we, you know, because it'll be like me giving it to him, you know, we brought on a new VP.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Caroline Walters: To amplify business development, accelerate, you know, however you want to word it, you know, that kind of thing.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Caroline Walters: Um, yeah. And I did, uh, because on a couple of things I know we identified, which I think this would just be kind of eye candy for the board.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Eric Severson: Do you need that?

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Caroline Walters: that we identified of the Fortune 500, how many we actually have partnerships with.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Caroline Walters: I'm sure they don't know that. I mean, I have mentioned it in the committee meetings, but it hasn't been a presentation to the board. So it would just be another way he can show how business development is, you know, the tentacles are reaching out and growing, so…

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Caroline Walters: nuggets of information like that. Um, I think we should include the two associations that, you know, Sherri brought on, the ENA and ANA should be in there, because they're huge. We might even, like.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Caroline Walters: Note the size of the organization.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.000
Caroline Walters: Um… and we probably should put that Filipino Nursing Association on there.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I mean…

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Caroline Walters: Because Nelson? Mm-hmm.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Eric Severson: Look at the healthcare, the healthcare thing from a… a people and a potential to impact.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Eric Severson: is huge. You know, it…

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Eric Severson: I would… I would think that education and healthcare.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Eric Severson: I'm still cranking through the…

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Eric Severson: analysis on…

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Eric Severson: The reporting for, uh, both your events and your, uh.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Eric Severson: Um… after action reports. And one of the things that did stick out to me is that education and nursing events are way up, and.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Eric Severson: we're down in EMS and in safety and in fire.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Eric Severson: Not…

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Caroline Walters: I know, we figured out why.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Eric Severson: Mmm, just… it's just, uh, I… I think… I'm not sure yet, but I suspect it's because you…

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Eric Severson: promoted some very strong players, and uh… I don't know how much.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Eric Severson: fill was done. It could be data. It may be that there's a gap in.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Eric Severson: managing the Salesforce data this last year that wasn't there previously.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Eric Severson: Uh, so it's a little of that, and it may be the dynamics of we've shifted attention.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Eric Severson: Uh, did you add staff in education and nursing, or how did that go?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Caroline Walters: Um, we did. So, when we… education came on board, Ernie was doing community colleges already.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000
Caroline Walters: And then, um, Garrett… Sherri hired Garrett as a rep.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Caroline Walters: And… but now, Kim Smith and Garrett… no, Kim Smith and Caroline Stringbilla are the education team.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Caroline Walters: supporting the College of Education with nursing Henry and Elizabeth.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Caroline Walters: And Natalie's the manager of that team.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Eric Severson: So again, I'll finish this up this weekend, and maybe we'll have a chat about it next week. It does look to me like there's.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Eric Severson: A 4% drop overall in leads generated over… year over year from last year to this year.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Eric Severson: And it does look like… that may not be bad news, by the way, because if you've got…

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Eric Severson: Two new disciplines, education and nursing.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Eric Severson: That are going to deliver more graduate, uh, students.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Eric Severson: than the falloff in fire and EMS, uh, or safety.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Eric Severson: Right? If you're trading bachelor's for master's, that's a good trade. I haven't gotten into that level of detail yet.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Eric Severson: And then the more, I mean, the gut on having been a sales manager for years, whenever you do management promotions and new portfolios.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Eric Severson: there's gonna be a dip, right? Because you take your highest performing people, you make them managers, they're gonna generate fewer.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Eric Severson: you know, leads or whatever it is as a manager than they were as an individual. And so, that's to be expected. It's a one-time thing. And then there's always the.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Eric Severson: are the new reps, uh… are they attending to Salesforce as well as the people you promoted? Probably not, right? They're probably not doing anything as well as the people you promoted. You promote your top performers, typically.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Eric Severson: And then you fill it with new people that have to come up a learning curve. So, the variation, I think it's important that you see and know and discuss it, but I don't think it's necessarily bad news. It could be good news, in fact, if you're.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
Eric Severson: Trading off a bandwidth trade and a new person trade for.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Eric Severson: disciplines that yield more masters and PhDs, that's a win for CSU.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Eric Severson: But then it's also a call out to go, do we need to rethink the, uh…

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Eric Severson: personnel assigned to those core disciplines? Are we doing enough in those?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Eric Severson: And I'm… if… if we can get the…

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Eric Severson: 26 events are starting to populate in Salesforce, I can also then give you a… here's what the 26 layout looks like compared to 25, 24, 23.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Eric Severson: for… by discipline. Here's the number of fire events, here's the number of, uh… is that helpful?

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Caroline Walters: It is helpful. Uh, something I did think of, our fire team at the beginning of 2025 was managed by Kimplash.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Caroline Walters: And she had Caroline Stringfellow.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Caroline Walters: I think it was the summer…

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Caroline Walters: Um, Sherri had some…

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Caroline Walters: HR issues with Stringfella and pulled her from the road.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Caroline Walters: So that's half the team that did… I don't know how many conferences she missed, but she's a heavy lead gen person.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Caroline Walters: So, some of that decrease could be a reflection that part of the team.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Caroline Walters: Was no… not doing it.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. Totally.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Caroline Walters: the work.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:14.000
Eric Severson: I mean, that stuff is very normal, and again, when we had… I had typically a district of 10 reps to a single manager.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Eric Severson: And you would see a manager that lost 3 reps was doomed. They were never going to make their number, right? Because.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Eric Severson: of the amount of time, especially with a calendar, the amount of time it took to hire, train, and at Pearson, it took 18 months to get a new rep to the point where they were really.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Eric Severson: accountable for their successes. It was a happy accident if the brand new rep was successful before that, so…

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Eric Severson: Variations in staffing and all those other things are absolutely, you know, uh, gonna impact your, basically, gen stuff.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Eric Severson: Um… and then, I guess the other thing I was thinking about is, if you're starting to, you know, look at.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Eric Severson: Staffing. How do you know when… how do you figure out, is staffing appropriate for the disciplines that we're in?

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Caroline Walters: We don't have enough. We're short-handed right now. We can't cover all the events we have opportunities for.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Caroline Walters: Um, like, for… we operated with a full team of 4, fire.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Eric Severson: Yes.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Caroline Walters: CJ and safety for a few years. I mean, ones and twos would go here and there, we'd hire somebody else, but we're…

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Caroline Walters: We are short-handed.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Caroline Walters: Period.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Eric Severson: Maybe I can help find a way to, you know, put that in a presentation, or quantify what's being left on the table, or the opportunity it could be.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Eric Severson: Uh, because again, you know, the… every executive is used to people saying, I need, I need, I want, I want more resources. But for you, the connection to revenue is pretty darn direct.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Eric Severson: And just to make that clear, you know, on here's what you would get for 2 more people in education.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Eric Severson: And by make it clear, project the number of bachelors, but most importantly, masters in.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Eric Severson: and PhD, that education is target-rich, I would think, for master's and PhD.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Eric Severson: Uh, as opposed to the bachelor's program. The other question I was very curious about is, did the conversation ever come up about pricing, uh, discipline-specific pricing?

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Eric Severson: I mean, we pay the same for… where our students pay the same tuition.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Eric Severson: for high-earning, uh, um, degrees versus low-earning degrees. Not to pick on social work people, but everybody knows I make peanuts.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Eric Severson: And everybody knows that cybersecurity people are going to make a lot of money.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.000
Eric Severson: Has that ever… has that ever come up as a topic?

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Caroline Walters: Um, I don't know that I've been in the room with senior executives as it has, but I mean.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Eric Severson: For that.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:57.000
Caroline Walters: The whole university is built to just be accessible to everybody.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Caroline Walters: per the family, right? So I don't think… they're not of the mind of having multi…

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Caroline Walters: price points…

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:11.000
Caroline Walters: As tuition, as it relates to tuition.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Eric Severson: I forget if you told me, or Tom told me that some of the pressure this year is coming from Ken having a record year and a family not getting very much profit.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Eric Severson: And so, as I think about stuff like that.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Eric Severson: When you start to connect growth ambition to all the other dynamics.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:34.000
Eric Severson: One way to improve the quantity of profit going to the families, which I bet would.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Eric Severson: soften this a little bit is to connect the cost of the degree to the average earning power of people in that sector, right? Why would you be giving people in the high earning.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000
Eric Severson: A break on the cost of their education.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Eric Severson: I mean, I don't know how… I have to… I'm fumbling with words, but you know who needs the break? It's a social worker, because their life's going to be difficult financially anyway.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Eric Severson: So, yeah, keep that low. But if you don't… I mean, there is a rationale to at least consider the correlation.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Eric Severson: to the earning income, the average earnings that we see out of the BLS, or any number of those areas.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Eric Severson: And that right there, you can afford, uh, to pay more if you know you're gonna get more on the other end of that, probably, maybe.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Eric Severson: And then that translates to an investment during high growth aspirations will be easier to do.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Eric Severson: if the people making all those calls are getting more, right? And one fast way to get more is differentiated pricing.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Eric Severson: But, you know, I get the… I get… and I think it's a special part of this place, making sure that it's accessible. It's one of the reasons that, you know, the resource limitation is easier to accept, is that it's genuine, it's authentic.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Eric Severson: you keep that price point down there, and I think that's a special part of CSU.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Eric Severson: just as I think about where would be…

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
Eric Severson: justifiable…

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Eric Severson: profit pickup, that's one of the things that sticks out is, huh…

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Eric Severson: You know, especially in some of those higher earning disciplines. And then there's… you can make it all data-driven. You can go to the BLS or any other.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:19.000
Eric Severson: source and go, I think most major universities do that a little bit differently. I don't think you're… but I'm not positive about that.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, I'm not 100% either, Eric, on how that's structured out.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, okay, done.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Caroline Walters: All right, so we can wrap this up, but I do, if you would prioritize.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Caroline Walters: doing that summary of what we talked about with this, uh, for Bonnie. I want to get that to them.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Caroline Walters: And so what can…

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Eric Severson: That'll happen in a matter of minutes.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Caroline Walters: Summarize it! Huh?

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Eric Severson: And the other thing, that'll happen in a matter of minutes, the other thing, what's your timeline for the other thing, for Ken?

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
Caroline Walters: Um, we got a few days.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Is there anything you can send me?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I asked him for… I asked him for a deadline, and I did not get one.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Caroline Walters: So…

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Okay.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Eric Severson: Uh…

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Eric Severson: I think that covers it. The…

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Eric Severson: I apologize about the… not having you on the meetings with, uh…

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Eric Severson: uh… compliance people.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Eric Severson: I am glad that, uh, Dale liked it.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Caroline Walters: He did like it. He told me he liked it.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:29.000
Eric Severson: Yep, I'm glad. It solves a problem that I was painfully experiencing in a past life, and I just solved it last weekend for a colleague that's still struggling with it, so…

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Eric Severson: So, good, and my goal is not to build it for them, but to demonstrate what is possible, and so if it's Connor that I can help.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Eric Severson: Uh, it will be to help them. If it's Jennifer Hopper Lee, fine. It's… I would much rather teach or demonstrate or make aware.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Eric Severson: I'm not looking to build things for other departments, so…

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, that's good. How does your meeting go with Sonya and Jennifer?

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Eric Severson: Uh, so, I am very used to meeting with compliance and legal, and I would never say that they're fun or interesting, or even high energy.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Eric Severson: So, I got the skeptical, who are you, why are we having this conversation?

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Eric Severson: Uh, Sonya said about 20 times, I want to have a conversation with everybody in the room, and I'll tell you, I don't do that. I don't float ideas with everybody in the room until I've gone around the committee and go, do you care about this?

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Eric Severson: is this a problem you want to solve? Here's a way to do it. Do you see this fitting? So there's never going to be a day that I'm going to go into a big meeting and go, here's a great idea that I have no idea if anybody gives a about, right? And so…

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Eric Severson: Uh, it's not gonna happen. And so that…

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Caroline Walters: Who was… who is she wanting in the room?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Eric Severson: Well, she wanted, uh, you, which you should have been in the room, but again, dragging you along for my discoveries.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Eric Severson: Uh, up to you, but, you know, is that a great use of your time? Maybe not.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Eric Severson: She wanted Dale in the room, she wanted BG in the room, she wanted… Jennifer was there.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Eric Severson: Um, so Jennifer did, I did, on my walk around and knocking on doors, waiting for Janelle, I did…

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Eric Severson: find Jennifer, introduce myself, we had a chat. Uh, Jennifer's a little frustrated with Sonia, so Jennifer's…

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Eric Severson: eager to do lots of work, and sounds to me like Sonia is giving her the, you go in this little box and stay over in that corner.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Eric Severson: And just do what I tell you, when I tell you, and don't do too much of it, which is…

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Eric Severson: Interesting, right? That's not going to stick around for that for very long.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and so, um…

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Eric Severson: She's the one that's doing all the work, and she's doing it all manually. And I'm of two minds of this, right? I am interested in getting to.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Caroline Walters: Hmm.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Eric Severson: can, at some point in demonstrating things. Let me show you. You have 2 more minutes? This is just quick show and tell.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Eric Severson: And I think this is, this could be relevant for you as well, uh, it just depends on how much you care about this stuff.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and so this is going to be a quick demo on…

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Eric Severson: Uh, use case for…

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Eric Severson: Let me reshare…

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Eric Severson: So this is my Google notebook. By the way, I'd love to share these things. One of the things that, you know, as you know, I'm already.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Eric Severson: somewhere between frustrated and annoyed with the level of lockdown on all IT things at CSU.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Eric Severson: Uh, here's a great example that seems super needless to me. I can't share anything into Google with anybody's CSU email address.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Eric Severson: I don't think that's a Google choice, I think that's an IT choice here, and so, you know, okay, I'm just going to keep it outside of CSU at that point.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Eric Severson: Um…

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Eric Severson: This morning, this morning.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Eric Severson: at O.30, before I got on my bike ride, which I left the garage at 5 AM, so this is at, like, 4.15.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:06.000
Eric Severson: I am reading Inside Higher Ed, which… let me see if I can't pull it up really quickly.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Eric Severson: Where is Inside Higher Ed this morning?

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Eric Severson: Here.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Eric Severson: what we learned about Ed's rulemaking playbook. So, they're doing all of this stuff, right?

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Caroline Walters: Hm?

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Eric Severson: And now, I'm guessing that we all wait for somebody inside of this organization to.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Eric Severson: read it, internalize it. At UTI, we had a whole division that did nothing but read the regs, internalize the regs, you'd get a comment back in weeks after it was actually done.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:47.000
Eric Severson: Right? High-stakes policy talk shed light on Ed's playbook. So I started reading this, and I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we're going through it to understand what's happening with these things.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Eric Severson: A lot of words, a lot of words, so many words, Caroline, I don't have time to read all these words. So, let's put it into.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Eric Severson: Notebook LM. And then let's go ahead and say…

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Eric Severson: What changed the most, uh… what changed with the most recent source document from the publication inside higher education?

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000
Eric Severson: This is my DOE.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Eric Severson: I think whatever this is to gainful employment, this is the notebook that I have that looks at all the sources.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Eric Severson: For the regulatory and compliance rulemaking that's about to change.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Eric Severson: Revelation of strong-arm tactics to secure consensus. There's politics about the DOE and, you know, the threats that they're doing.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Eric Severson: threat strategy, leveraging gainful employment. A specific major revelation is that Ed was threatened to scrap or significantly weaken the existing gainful employment rule, which holds for for-profit colleges accountable.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:51.000
Eric Severson: if institutional representation did not vote yes on the new accountability framework for traditional colleges. Now, I think that's wonderful.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Eric Severson: Having been in both not-for-profit and for-profit, I think it was shitty and disingenuous.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Eric Severson: to put gainful employment in all those rigs only on for-profit, especially after they cleaned it up. When they started in the 90s, there were way too many really shitty actors in for-profit. They're now gone and out of business.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Caroline Walters: Yep.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Eric Severson: And so, to not hold everyone to the same standard, I think sucks. So, seeing that, great. Strong-arm tactics, great.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Eric Severson: Uh, explanation of legal aid, absenteeism, new playbook for negotiations, condensed timelines, limited public input, hard lines.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Eric Severson: So, it took me 5 minutes to load this in, it took me 5 minutes to scan this to go… the advantages are still really in CSU's favor across a number of.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Eric Severson: places. Uh, then, before I walked out, I wanted to say, you know, what are the updated strategic advantages.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Eric Severson: for CSU, just to make sure that I had a quick glimpse at our talking points and the implications. Why? Are there implications for CSU that would put us in undue duress or stress from either a reporting perspective, which will cost resources.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Eric Severson: When I'm asking for more marketing support, if we have to put it all in compliance, which sucks, then that's going to be a drain. I just want to, you know, start to think about those things.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Eric Severson: Uh, are there… are there any other big implications for business development, or for funding, or for anything else that might factor into, you know, knowing what Ken is struggling with, what the institution might be struggling with?

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Eric Severson: It took me no time at all to take that research report, plop it in here, and start asking questions about it, you know, was there a major change that changes things?

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Eric Severson: there was not. And so, for Ken, what I want to see is…

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Eric Severson: This takes no effort. It's not as good as having a compliance department, but this will help you be informed instantly.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Eric Severson: Without having to read the full contents of the article, but then be able to ask questions of your compliance department more effectively.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Eric Severson: And so, this is one of those moments where I think, yeah, we could make cute graphics off of this, I don't think I did.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Eric Severson: I might have.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Eric Severson: navigating federal accountability for CSU? I mean, it's possible that a graphic like this could be useful for board presentation, if he has to be on the hook for.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Eric Severson: Describing the old to the new system, uh, and what are the key implications.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Eric Severson: potential distortions for CSU. I mean, honestly, when I go to these, I'm like, wow, awesome, regional earnings mismatch? That was one of the things that changed. So, initially, the rulemaking was.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Eric Severson: Regional earnings were going to be the benchmark that you were held accountable to.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Eric Severson: Unless 50% or more of your graduates are from out of state, which immediately qualifies CSU.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Eric Severson: Then, you would be held to the national earnings benchmark for each of the disciplines.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Eric Severson: Is that a big deal? Is that a good guy or a bad guy for CSU? Because of the age demographic mismatch.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Eric Severson: This is all set up for a younger benchmark. They're aimed at traditional colleges, and thank God.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Eric Severson: this organization focuses on working adults, the national earnings isn't really that punitive, because we still have, at average age 39, people that are making more than anybody that comes right out of college in that.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Caroline Walters: Hm?

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Eric Severson: You know, 25 to 34 aid bucket is gonna make in that first job.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Caroline Walters: Oh.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Eric Severson: And then, you know, the intense scrutiny is fine, we don't have anybody that's got findings or degrees that are in trouble, so…

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Eric Severson: So I thought this was an interesting way to use Notebook LM to go through.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Caroline Walters: Hmm.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:55.000
Eric Severson: dense amounts of material. Once you get used to it, honestly, I did this in 15 minutes with a cup of coffee sitting in my bike clothes at 4.15 this morning.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Eric Severson: And then went through it and went, cool. I got, you know, based on that article, I understand there are 2 or 3 things that I need to mull over a little bit to figure out what are… what's relevance to us, if any.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000
Eric Severson: And then, you know, use it as a potential use case for Ken.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Eric Severson: What do you think about that?

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, I think it would definitely be nice to show him what's… what's out there, because he doesn't know, right?

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Caroline Walters: Um, I think Tom…

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Eric Severson: How would you like to do that? Would you, would you be open to doing a meeting every 2 weeks, once a month?

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Eric Severson: 30 minutes, quick flyby, it could be you, me, and Ken. It could be a broader number of executives, and saying.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Eric Severson: here's… here's what's changing in AI that you should be thinking about. Here are some tools we're aware of, here are some tools, here's a couple of use cases inside the university.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Caroline Walters: So, I think the first should be you, Ken, and myself.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Caroline Walters: and then ask Ken, is this something you would be interested in doing?

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Caroline Walters: Monthly. And would you want to?

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Eric Severson: It would also be…

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, okay. It would also be possible for me to start doing, uh, quick YouTube videos and say, you know, here's something to think about, here's something that's happening this week in AI, here's a quick, you know, 15-minute flyby.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Eric Severson: Of this stuff, and then… and then we could leave it up to, you know.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
Eric Severson: We could try that.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Caroline Walters: When are you back in Orange Beach?

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Eric Severson: So, uh, I am flying out next Friday to…

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Eric Severson: Jacksonville, and then Tuesday to Tallahassee for the space event.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Eric Severson: And I have a one-way ticket, I haven't done anything else, because I was kind of waiting to see if we couldn't get an.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Eric Severson: on-site visit with the CTR guy at one of the Alabama manufacturers that they're doing training in.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Eric Severson: Um, but I could… so I… I'm open, I could come to CSU that week.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Caroline Walters: That's the week… the first week of February.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Eric Severson: That is… yes, that's the first week of February, so…

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Caroline Walters: Alright.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Caroline Walters: So…

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Caroline Walters: Alright, let me see if Ken is available.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Caroline Walters: And I actually, on the 3rd, I have a one-on-one meeting with him.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Caroline Walters: And let me confirm…

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Eric Severson: That's the day we've got our… that's the day we've got our space thing.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Caroline Walters: Ah, okay.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
Eric Severson: We're in Tallahassee on the 3rd.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Caroline Walters: So it would be probably the 5th?

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Eric Severson: 4th or 5th, yeah. I mean, tell… I was thinking… I was either gonna go back to Jacksonville and go home, or drive on to, uh, Orange Beach and hang out and go home on Friday.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Caroline Walters: Fourth or 5th?

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Caroline Walters: From experience, this will be way more impactful if you do the first time with Ken in person.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Sure.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Caroline Walters: So that's what I was trying to… and I'll see if we can get an hour of his time, and you… and I'll just say, hey.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Caroline Walters: it's show and tell. Eric, it's got some cool stuff he's been sharing with me.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Caroline Walters: We both thought this would be meaningful for you, and…

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Caroline Walters: you know, between that time, what aren't we meeting with Dale and Sonya and that group next week?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Caroline Walters: Or something? Did I see a calendar invite for that, maybe?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Eric Severson: And…

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Eric Severson: Yes, that's next week.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Eric Severson: Do you… how do you want to handle Scott? Do you… do you want… I mean, there's a couple things that I keep thinking about here. One…

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Eric Severson: opening up access to the existing tools, right? Because, again, that is going to encourage experimentation, it's going to encourage.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Eric Severson: That's smart, right? You want people to be able to work with those tools. Uh, and then…

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Eric Severson: We should be debating an enterprise deal with one of the major labs, either Google, Anthropic.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Eric Severson: I don't know that I do OpenAI, but one of them, uh, beyond Microsoft. Microsoft…

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Eric Severson: Sucks, right? It's the solid 5th place in capabilities and tools.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Eric Severson: Uh, so…

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Eric Severson: What's the best way to have that conversation and win in that conversation?

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Caroline Walters: That's a good question, Eric. Um…

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Eric Severson: Thanks.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:20.000
Caroline Walters: I think the thing is, let's go to Ken and say, hey, this is… this is some things I'm playing around with and using. These are some things I've shared with Caroline. We thought you might be interested.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Caroline Walters: And then, instead of saying, we need to do this, maybe say to Ken.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Caroline Walters: Ken, how do you think… do you want the university to be more engaged with AI?

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Caroline Walters: Yes or no? He's probably gonna say yes. Who do you have leading those efforts?

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Caroline Walters: Because nobody's leading that, really. I mean, they've got this AI committee, but I sat in a meeting yesterday.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Eric Severson: I'm on it, we haven't met, we haven't met for 3 months, right?

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Caroline Walters: Well, I met yesterday, because the executives are on another oversight committee for it, and Eric, all we talked about was glossary definitions.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Eric Severson: AI.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, dumb use of… there should be… there should be a documented strategy.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Caroline Walters: So…

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Eric Severson: Right? And if you're talking about glossary definitions, you're lost in the weeds with senior executives. They should have.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Eric Severson: a one-page, one-slide strategy. Here's the strategy that we have.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:21.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, um, that wasn't the case. So, I mean, you need to be.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Caroline Walters: be prepared for him to say, well, this falls under Jason and his team.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Eric Severson: Does it? Okay.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Caroline Walters: Well, I mean, his team is doing this whole AI committee.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Caroline Walters: To which nothing's happened with, and we really hadn't seen much of what his department's even doing.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Eric Severson: I'm trying to help them.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Caroline Walters: I mean, maybe it takes a long time.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Eric Severson: Well, so, what I am observing is that they are enormously tactical.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Eric Severson: They have traditional IT people that are…

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Eric Severson: Working on policy and glossaries.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Eric Severson: The world is moving past. The world is moving forward, right? So…

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Eric Severson: Do we need policies in glossaries? Yup. Is that the strategy? You better hope it isn't, right? That is not… that is not the strategy.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Eric Severson: And so, you know, how… and…

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:25.000
Eric Severson: I will try to help Jason, but I definitely see that there's a mindset that's not strategic, it's, uh, tactical.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Eric Severson: And…

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Caroline Walters: Well, and you… and we don't know what he's been tasked with, either.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Eric Severson: Fair. And the data thing is a nightmare. You need to get the data thing sorted out.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Caroline Walters: you know…

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Eric Severson: What you want on top of that, though, is…

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Eric Severson: before you have your data sorted out, you need a strategy. You need a broad strategy for.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Eric Severson: What do we want AI to do, or how do we envision it contributing.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:56.000
Eric Severson: to the different parts of the university, and then what is our roadmap to those things?

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Eric Severson: When you… and that can happen concurrently to the data transformation that is consuming and difficult and painful and ugly.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Eric Severson: But once you get there, you don't want to then sit down and go, now what's our strategy, right? You want to have the rest of that.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Eric Severson: Clicking. And Jason tells me, for access, it all goes back to IT.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Eric Severson: Right? And Scott will tell me, Jason needs to do it. And so, at some of these points, I'm like, what the.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Eric Severson: Get your stuff sorted out, boys. Get it figured out, right? And I think that's a…

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Eric Severson: Scott wants to do nothing, and Jason doesn't know how to open and actionize these things. I kind of wonder if we shouldn't go meet with Scott at some point and go.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.000
Eric Severson: where are you on this? Where do you… where do you perceive the, uh, strategy, or the…

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Eric Severson: You know, the things that we might want to do, right? Is there…

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Eric Severson: a mechanism for us to do those, or is it just no? And then, if it's just no, then at least we've done that so that if it comes up with Ken.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Eric Severson: We can say, yep, did that, checkbox, here's what was said.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, we definitely need to meet with Scott before we say anything like.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Caroline Walters: Well, we think this should be doing this, because his next question's going to be, what did Scott say?

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, that's what I thought, too.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Caroline Walters: Every time.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Caroline Walters: Every time. So, um…

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
Caroline Walters: Let me look back here.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Caroline Walters: I have a one-on-one with Scott next week that I could plant the seed with.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Eric Severson: Wonderful.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Caroline Walters: And, um…

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Eric Severson: And I think that's just… how are we thinking about.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Eric Severson: AI.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Eric Severson: I mean, of the department that should be leading the use of AI?

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Eric Severson: He… I would ask him, are your developers using it? Because…

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Eric Severson: They could…

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Eric Severson: They should be leading. The AI tools are tuned and built for developers, first and foremost.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000
Eric Severson: And they could absolutely increase.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Eric Severson: The velocity that they are doing their development without increasing their headcount at all.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Eric Severson: But, they have to be taught. You have to have a tolerance for learning curves, right? A little bit of failure in that, coming up to speed.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Eric Severson: Thing, and it's, you know, it's accelerating dramatically right now in…

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Eric Severson: Uh, in the… in code development, in software development.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Eric Severson: If you… so they would be curious to know how you're feeling about that, how you're doing that, and then…

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Eric Severson: how should we be thinking about AI in… across the business divisions, right? And it starts there with just probing around for.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Eric Severson: we should probably be building our use cases for university relations, right? And I'd be happy to do… to start helping do that.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Eric Severson: Uh, it might require…

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Caroline Walters: Well, and I think that's where we may get more movement if we're, like, starting with our department.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Caroline Walters: Like, I understand if this is not a university-wide flipping a switch on something, but hey, can you flip our switch?

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Caroline Walters: we want to play around with this. We see… I mean, you're an AI consultant.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Caroline Walters: Let… let us do that. Piggy.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Eric Severson: Maybe that's the way to handle Scott right out of the gates, is could we get some.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Eric Severson: Some exceptions to work with the tools, meaning, you know, the Google stuff.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Eric Severson: we'd like to use the Google tools. Can we… and, you know, can we start to look at experimentation? We'll build the use cases, document the use cases.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Eric Severson: I mean, just like this thing that we were talking about with Zoom for Sherri's group, that is the gain for you and for Sherri to have.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:54.000
Eric Severson: not instant, but access to a level of insight that's very difficult. I have struggled for decades to try to pull that knowledge out of distributed groups, and now.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Caroline Walters: Mm-hmm.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Eric Severson: You know, I think, geez, there's just so much potential to make that a reality without overburdening people with a bunch of tasks.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah. Yeah. Um…

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Eric Severson: So… Okay.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Eric Severson: Cool.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Caroline Walters: I'll… if you'll think about what we want to ask Scott about, like, of course, the Zoom things that have been blocked, and I would think that.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Caroline Walters: Microsoft Pilot, didn't you say there's some things there? I mean, those are things people are using, and I don't think it's a big ass to have some things turned on.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I'll try to be very specific about that.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Eric Severson: Yep. Yep.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:34.000
Eric Severson: I'll put that together and get it to you, uh, early part of next week, because I think that's… I think that's a great strategy, and worth mulling over, and…

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Caroline Walters: Okay.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Eric Severson: puts us in a better position later. And maybe, if we can't get all of those conversations squared away before we are doing Notebook LM with Ken, then maybe we'll just not talk about.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Eric Severson: the rest of the stuff, right? Because I do want to get the steps in order and see, you know, Jason and.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah, yeah.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Eric Severson: Scott, uh, ample opportunity to, you know, weigh in before we go.

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Eric Severson: having this conversation with Ken.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Caroline Walters: Exactly, because I don't want to make any…

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Caroline Walters: I don't make anybody… turn anybody's Apple card over.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:12.000
Eric Severson: Perfect. Me either, me either. So, thank you, there's a lot of time. It was not a short meeting. Appreciate it.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Caroline Walters: Yeah.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Caroline Walters: I know! This was a good time. I appreciate it too, and I'll be looking for your email summary about the nursing thing, and then I'll get that done, and.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Caroline Walters: Are you on the meeting this afternoon?

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Eric Severson: I am not.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Caroline Walters: The admissions meeting?

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Eric Severson: Nope.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
Caroline Walters: Well, count yourself lucky.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Eric Severson: What is happening with admissions? Brian.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:36.000
Caroline Walters: No, we have… we have a standing meeting with them that is… absolutely could be an email.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Caroline Walters: So…

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Caroline Walters: Basically, I attend, Sherri talks, that mission people talk, and it's over.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
Eric Severson: I do like…

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Eric Severson: I do like, uh, his second-in-command quite a bit. I think she's got really…

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Eric Severson: She's sharp lady, yeah.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
Caroline Walters: Oh, okay.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Caroline Walters: She sure is, she sure is, yeah.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Caroline Walters: Cindy. Alright, thanks, Eric. Talk to you later.

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Eric Severson: Okay, great talking to you.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Eric Severson: See you. You bet. Bye-bye.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Eric Severson: Note to the AI meeting summary. I would like you to skip all of the non-business content and only focus on the business content.
