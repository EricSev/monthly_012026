00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Eric Severson: Morning, Tony.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Tony Atchley: Good morning.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Eric Severson: I'm sitting here working on a note to Luke, trying to make sure that we're…

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Eric Severson: all aligned on, uh, really trying to make sure that I've got.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Eric Severson: As good a handle on what the likely volume would be.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Eric Severson: as we go into… as I schedule meetings with Continuing Ed. And do you want to participate in that? I've got…

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Eric Severson: I don't know that the…

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Eric Severson: Provost is going to meet with me, but the manager is. And what I really want to know is…

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Eric Severson: How are you?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Eric Severson: How do you look at pricing? How do you look at duration? And when I look back at the notes for Luke.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Eric Severson: It was, it looked to me like it's.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Eric Severson: 6 weeks of online work with, uh, validation and an.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Eric Severson: on-premming. Maybe when we're done with this weekend, we can catch up.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Tony Atchley: Okay.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Eric Severson: Briefly on this. So, uh, and is Dwayne joining? I didn't see.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, I don't know, dude.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Eric Severson: He was on there, but maybe he didn't see that it moved.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Eric Severson: Okay, this is just really a good chance to catch up after the holidays. Hope everybody had a great holiday, and… and uh…

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Tony Atchley: I'll text him.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Eric Severson: Oh, you're on mute there, Jim.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Eric Severson: Uh, so to catch up and to do the focus of these, which is gonna be what's your focus for the week.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Eric Severson: Is there anything you need? Uh, or are you stuck with anything? And then I'm gonna start to ask you.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Eric Severson: How are you using AI this week? Just… just as a curiosity, right? As a way to keep… keep…

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Eric Severson: Uh, helping people move forward in their AI journey. So, uh, so Jim, what's, what's, uh, what's the focus for the week?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Jim.Forsythe: Focus for the week.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Jim.Forsythe: Got a ton of follow-up. Uh, Wednesday morning, I am attending a State of the City in Baymonette.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Jim.Forsythe: Our good friends from Novellas always have representation there, so I'd like to be able to mingle with those folks.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, Josh Brown is the new mayor there, and I got to know Josh about 3 years ago through the Eastern Shore Chamber. He's the sales manager for a computer consulting company.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Jim.Forsythe: That's in Mobile and that, and he decided to run for mayor, and he was the first African American to be elected mayor of Baymonette.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Eric Severson: Wow, okay.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Jim.Forsythe: And, uh, we got to be good friends, like I said, a few years ago. He came to the space launch meeting that we had at the campus a while back.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Jim.Forsythe: And, uh, brought some of his new city council members. So, uh, hoping to tie that together.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, hoping Ryan Brantley, who is the EHS director for Novellus, they hired him back in.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Jim.Forsythe: July or August. I met him in September at a conference. He's a CSU graduate.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Jim.Forsythe: And it's kind of worked his way up, uh, through the safety field, and now he's been hired as the director of VHS for Novellus going forward.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Jim.Forsythe: And I understand he's gonna be building out a team, probably of about 30 people or so. I'm also working with marketing, and he's agreed to do this, to do a personal interest story for one of our.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Jim.Forsythe: Partner newsletters that we have.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Jim.Forsythe: So, they're working with him to do that, so I'm hoping that gets our… we have a good relationship with Novellas, they just don't move. They don't do anything, as far as a partnership goes.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Eric Severson: And what… what does Novellus do?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Jim.Forsythe: Aluminum. Aluminum Recycling present coil aluminum, they build, uh…

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Eric Severson: Aluminum.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Jim.Forsythe: every car has some novelis aluminum in it. Uh, they produce the aluminum for all the F-150 pickup truck exteriors.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, it's a… if you Google it, it's a… they aren't even in operation yet. This is a big catch for Baldwin County.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Jim.Forsythe: And, uh, they have one building out there that's over a mile long that they're… that they're putting in place. That's just one of the buildings.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Jim.Forsythe: It's gonna be a huge operation here.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Eric Severson: Employing how many people about?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, at the end, it's gonna probably be close to 2,000.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Eric Severson: That's… that's amazing. And…

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Jim.Forsythe: Sure.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Eric Severson: How are they…

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Eric Severson: staffing today, do you know? I mean, how many people are…

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, well, the building's up. They don't… they're staffing slowly, building up key positions, but they won't… Tony, do you know when they're to occupy that building?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, I've not heard, you know, I've not heard the final on it, but, you know, so they've got…

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Jim.Forsythe: It's gonna be over a year yet.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Tony Atchley: They've got locations, uh, you know, across the country already. This is just a new plant operation here, but…

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Jim.Forsythe: Yeah.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Tony Atchley: Um, they… they have been pulling in, uh, a lot of, you know, the key leadership, I think, from, uh, those…

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Tony Atchley: other sites, right, Jim? You know, and getting this up and going?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Jim.Forsythe: Yeah, yeah, the, uh, the director came… Novellus is actually… the parent company is located in Canada.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, their U.S. operations are based in Atlanta, and this is going to be the largest plant that they've built to date.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, so it's a big deal in this… it's a big deal in this market.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Eric Severson: Okay. So…

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, so a couple…

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Eric Severson: And what's the… how do you think about the strategy of who do you try to build a relationship with there? Who do we ultimately need to get to somebody, I suppose, in HR, right, to tell the story about.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Jim.Forsythe: Well, I know… I've known Amanda for a couple of years now, who's the head of HR. A guy by my name is Tony Holt is the head site manager, and we've met on several occasions, so…

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, I'm about as high up as I can go here locally, and uh, we're very cordial, very… and she's told me, you know, I've said, hey, Amanda, I said, have you forgotten about me? I'm still here. She says, oh, I haven't forgotten about you, you'll hear from us sometime when we're ready.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Jim.Forsythe: So…

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Jim.Forsythe: I just go and meet them and be nice.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Eric Severson: So, what I'm wondering about is, uh…

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Jim.Forsythe: Let them know I'm still here.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Eric Severson: we've got two interesting opportunities that are maybe a little different than the things that we've done in the past at CSU.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Eric Severson: One of them is through the Sigma Mutual partnership with a company called CTR.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Eric Severson: And the other is with a potential partnership with, uh, American Diesel Training Centers.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Eric Severson: And the crux of them are these are companies that are either staffing or recruiting agencies that were working with clients on staffing programs.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Eric Severson: where they could not fill it with local talent. They just didn't have enough local talent.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Eric Severson: And so, both these, uh, CTR is a staffing company, and ADTC is sort of a recruiting, uh, entity and a training.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Eric Severson: They built short, 10-week training programs.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Eric Severson: To onboard people into these, uh…

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Eric Severson: Skilled trades like positions.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Eric Severson: And so, Jim, what I'm wondering is, it seems like a great opportunity to have the conversation from… and we'll give you a little bit more information, I'd love to participate in the conversation, so maybe Tony.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Eric Severson: to explore the business potential for a slightly different model. Recruiting services.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Eric Severson: That aims at the type of employee that you need locally, that may not live there locally today, as a way to say, we'll find employees, we'll train them if they are trainable on those skill trade roles.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Eric Severson: In that 6-10 week frame, and then they'll move right into employ for you.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Eric Severson: And then, you know, I'm envisioning this as potentially a continuing education offering.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Eric Severson: similar to the one that we have with the Fire Chief Association. Um…

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Eric Severson: But then it could also… the story of CSU being involved is…

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Eric Severson: from labor to leader, right? So, yes, this is a path to immediate employment.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Eric Severson: Interesting, I'm not sure that we participate in.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Eric Severson: that revenue stream today, meaning taking totally unskilled, giving them a, you know, I'm trying to find a polite word for it, but I'd call it a survival skills.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Eric Severson: Enough to get employed, but then also thinking about long-term is, if there are going to be 2,000 people in that, uh, plant.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Eric Severson: There's going to be a need to promote from within, but there's going to need to be an ongoing need for management, and that's where the sort of credentialing story comes in.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Eric Severson: So, that all goes back to maybe this is an opportunity to really dig into the staffing plan, and how are you thinking about the staffing plan, and.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Eric Severson: You know, do you think you have enough local labor source or talent to be able to pull into those jobs?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Eric Severson: And if not, then this is something interesting that we're just really at the proposal stages with, but with two different companies.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Eric Severson: ADTC does this today, but they want to offload the educational piece. Same thing with CTR, they want to offload the educational piece.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Eric Severson: And the interesting thing is…

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Eric Severson: both ADTC, American Diesel Training Centers, they focus on…

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Eric Severson: uh, HVAC technicians and field service technicians. Vertiv and Comfort Systems are huge corporate clients of theirs.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Eric Severson: And they just can't find enough people for this. So that's where they flipped this model of just recruiting to.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Eric Severson: recruiting people that are not qualified today, training them in a short sprint, getting them employed, and then… then they're sort of stuck, both CTR and ADCC, and that's where we're.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Eric Severson: investigating the CSU potential role there. Jim, do you… what do you think about all that? Do you think it would be of any interest to, uh…

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Jim.Forsythe: I mean, it could be. I can tell you right now, they have strong partnerships with the Coastal Community College system.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, they also work where they actually help them design programs and courses.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Jim.Forsythe: Coastal Community College is actually based… they have campuses all around the area here.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Jim.Forsythe: But they're actually based in Baymonette, just a few miles where that plant location is.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, they also have strong ties with Bishop State, uh, which so does Airbus and Austell.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Jim.Forsythe: A lot of other places, they do a lot of custom training. And then they've opened a new, uh… what do they call it? Baldwin County Academy.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Jim.Forsythe: Which is a high school program, where they go, you know, 2 years at their regular school, then they go 2 years at the… at the high school training academy, which is.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Eric Severson: Hmm.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Jim.Forsythe: kind of, they market it as the gym of Alabama. It's really a huge facility, and they partner with them, training high school kids to build that pipeline.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Jim.Forsythe: So, they've got people in those roles, not meaning that we couldn't participate with that.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Jim.Forsythe: It's just something that hasn't been a CSU niche in the past, and you can…

00:12:49.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Jim.Forsythe: drive that battle. I have approached, uh, in the past, I had some things going on with, uh, Buffalo Rock, which is the big Pepsi distributor in that for the Southeast.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Jim.Forsythe: They were looking at some workshops and company training, and…

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Jim.Forsythe: I got to where that's not kind of what our niche is.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Jim.Forsythe: So…

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Eric Severson: And who… how… what was your path to that?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Eric Severson: discussion.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Jim.Forsythe: Up through academics.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Jim.Forsythe: Janelle?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Eric Severson: Who specifically was that with? Misty?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Jim.Forsythe: Um… don't know, I don't recall…

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Tony Atchley: No. No, at the time, it was, um, Lee… was it Lee Lawson? Um, I may not have the right name.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Jim.Forsythe: Not Lawson, he's, uh, Lee…

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Jim.Forsythe: I don't remember, Tony.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, it's not, not Lawson's, uh, but he was in Misty's position.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Jim.Forsythe: He's no longer here, and…

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, prior to Misty taking over that department, Eric. Yep. Yep.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Eric Severson: Okay. So, things change. I mean, CTR has all those relationships you just mentioned with all those community colleges.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Tony Atchley: Yep.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Eric Severson: And there's a couple of things, without getting shitty. The community college product is always pretty poor, right? It just is. Otherwise…

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Eric Severson: there would be no need for this stuff. Plus, they're already… they're already based in a local community.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Eric Severson: So, a fair amount of what these recruiters are doing is tapping labor outside.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Eric Severson: Labor potential. High potential laborers that are outside of that geography. They're recruiting them, they're training them, then they're moving them into those jobs in those areas.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Eric Severson: CTR, again, they have Bishop State they've done pilots with. The Coastal Community College they've done pilots with.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Eric Severson: They're using them for a specific on-ground purpose, but they're still coming to us saying, you guys are the gold standard in safety, we'd really like to look at.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Eric Severson: doing that. We really don't enjoy registering students, putting them through this. They're using the facilities of these locations.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Eric Severson: And so it's interesting, I mean, we may end up right back at that same location of somebody at CSU saying, this is not our niche.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Eric Severson: But… things do change, and I think it's a… the way that I want to…

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Eric Severson: pursue this is this is a direct connection to workforce development and employer response to employer demand.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Eric Severson: That's not a niche we should ignore, honestly. If you want to ignore that, that's a profound statement.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Eric Severson: Uh, at this juncture in the world. I don't think they're going to say we want to ignore that.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Eric Severson: What we're gonna do is put together some, uh, some financials to show how this thing might work.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Eric Severson: And it all rolls back to just a curiosity about… I'm sorry, what was the company's name?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Jim.Forsythe: Novellas.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Tony Atchley: Novellas.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Eric Severson: Novellas, just a curiosity about their staffing plan, the confidence that they're going to find that locally, their past experiences.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Eric Severson: with the bishop states and the community colleges. I don't think it's a mutually exclusive option. I think what we're talking about might be complementary.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Eric Severson: To those other providers in a way that is maybe faster.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and in a way that is gonna tap potential outside of that local community area.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Eric Severson: So, Jim will keep me… yep.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Jim.Forsythe: Eric, just as a… just as a piece of information, they recruit nationally now.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Eric Severson: Who?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Jim.Forsythe: Novellas.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Eric Severson: For qualified candidates, right?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Jim.Forsythe: Yes. Yeah, they recruit… they have a whole national recruiting thing to bring people in, and…

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Eric Severson: So, this model…

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Jim.Forsythe: Which is maybe different than what you're talking about, which, I mean, it is different, but I'm just saying that, you know.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Jim.Forsythe: they've done this before, and I know they have a strong recruiting arm. I've met several of their people. I've met folks from Ohio that have moved here to take roles with them, and.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, so the difference there is CTR experienced exactly the same thing. CTR is a commercial recruiting company. That's what they do, and then they provide the staffing.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Jim.Forsythe: So…

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Eric Severson: And in particular, in the shipbuilding industry, and maybe it doesn't apply to novellas because of the geography and the location and all that stuff.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Eric Severson: But in shipbuilding, they were unable as a professional recruiting agency to find enough qualified candidates.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Eric Severson: frankly, anywhere, uh, relocation or local. And that's when they started developing this, this model.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Eric Severson: Of recruiting high potential, but unskilled, giving them this 10-week training program, and then moving them directly into those entry-level labor jobs, like welder, ship fitter, that kind of stuff.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Eric Severson: And so the, the question would just simply be back to your contact at Novellus is.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Eric Severson: how are you feeling about your staffing plan? You know, is there anything… do you think you're going to be able to find enough qualified people on your timelines?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Eric Severson: And if they say, yep, then the only other potential thing to throw in there is we're working with other partners on this new innovative model.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Eric Severson: Uh, that if you get… if you're interested, we'd be delighted to sit down and talk with you more about it.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Eric Severson: And again, it's, uh… the reason I'm…

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Eric Severson: curious about this is Signal Mutual and CTR have already been doing it in the shipbuilding industry, ADTC is doing it in the automotive industry, in the field service technician industry, and in the.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Eric Severson: HVAC industry.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Eric Severson: And that it is…

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Eric Severson: There isn't enough qualified labor for these roles, and so they're going to not qualified labor, high potential labor that they can skill up in a short amount of time.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Eric Severson: to move into that, those entry-level labor jobs. If that doesn't apply to novellas, that's cool, but that, as you were talking about that, I thought, wow, what a great opportunity.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Eric Severson: to add a new twist to the conversation, where CSU is not traditionally played here, and we don't have the approval to this week we're going to meet with CE. I think this starts as a.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Eric Severson: CE program, and then maybe, you know, depending on.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Eric Severson: where it goes after that. But it's a whole new revenue source for CSU, and it solves a problem that, again, we see in 3 distinct.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Eric Severson: places, if not more, with companies that are already out there doing it, they're coming to PSU because they're interested in scale.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Eric Severson: How do we get out from underneath the online delivery piece? They're doing it in person, and there's a bunch of different problems with that, but being able to scale that.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Eric Severson: Is what they're curious about, so…

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Eric Severson: So we'll keep you informed, Jim, if that gives you one more thing to talk about with novella's Cool, if it doesn't work out, then, you know, hey.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Eric Severson: it may not be a niche that CSU wants to play in, so…

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Jim.Forsythe: Okay.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Eric Severson: Uh, is there anything you need help with this week, Jim?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, no.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Eric Severson: that marketing piece that, uh, that you fulfilled the request for, how do you get feedback on what's happening after you put a request in like that?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Jim.Forsythe: I call them.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Eric Severson: And how often… is there a delivery date, a need-by date, that we put in those things?

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, the last thing I got was that they were looking at, rather than doing a brochure or anything like that, they were looking at doing.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Jim.Forsythe: One of our tabletop pull-ups.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Jim.Forsythe: that I could take with me, and they could get that done in a couple of weeks. And quite frankly, I don't care what they give me, as long as it says something on there about partnered with U.S. Space Command.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Eric Severson: Uh-huh. Yep.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Jim.Forsythe: If I just get a sheet of paper that says, CSU is partnered with U.S. Space Command, I can take it from there. That's all I want on there.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, so they're working on that. Uh, Mike wanted to make sure that.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Jim.Forsythe: that was okay to say. But, you know, and I don't know what MOU… you know, Mike and Joanne worked on this MOU with U.S. Space Command. They had all those contacts, so I don't know what document they signed.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Jim.Forsythe: But most of our MOUs have a place on there where they authorize us using their.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Jim.Forsythe: logo, or whatever. Now, I don't know if they maybe didn't authorize it, but…

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Jim.Forsythe: Mike has that MOU, so I've asked him to review that, and look at that, and see if there's any option, or…

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Jim.Forsythe: Because if we're gonna go to these space programs, my gosh, I mean, we need something like that for credibility right off the bat, I think.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, totally agree, totally agree. And so, do you get to look at it before they put it into production, or how does that typically work?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, sometimes yes, mostly no.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Eric Severson: And so, the issue of the logos, I would assume that it should be okay, because our logo is on their site, listed as a partner, right?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Jim.Forsythe: Mm-hmm, mhm.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Eric Severson: Uh, how do you make sure that that happens?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Eric Severson: You just send them a note saying, hey, the logo is important, can you let me know if this is gonna happen?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Jim.Forsythe: Yeah, I've been doing that. There's been a whole chain of emails about that, yeah.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Eric Severson: Okay, okay.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Eric Severson: Okay, okay. And is it…

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Jim.Forsythe: Were you copied on those, Tony? I don't know. I don't remember who's on them.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Tony Atchley: No, no, I wasn't copied on.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Jim.Forsythe: A lot of people… there's a lot of people on it.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Eric Severson: Yep. Uh, I would love to see those, only because I'm thinking about marketing process, marketing approval process, especially as it goes to landing pages.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Jim.Forsythe: Yeah.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Jim.Forsythe: Well…

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Eric Severson: And other assets, just to get a handle on it myself.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Jim.Forsythe: here's… here's where it's at. It's with, uh, Lucinda in the marketing department.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Jim.Forsythe: And she works with academics, and the reason for that, and I'm just going by what I've been told and what people want me to do, is that the content for our brochures and our flyers all come out of academics.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Jim.Forsythe: So, they designed…

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Jim.Forsythe: the brochures that we have, the flyers, and the content of all of that. So, rather than going through our marketing folks.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Jim.Forsythe: when I say are, I mean the people who work with outreach and that. Lucinda is a resource for academics, so it's kind of going through.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Jim.Forsythe: They all report up through Dale, but I mean, it's kind of going through that…

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Eric Severson: So, Lucinda gets all the content from a subject matter expert in academics?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Jim.Forsythe: Channel.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Jim.Forsythe: Correct. Is that your understanding, Tony?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Eric Severson: Okay, and then who thinks about…

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Eric Severson: Who thinks about the persuasive aspect of how to present that?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah. It would always be good to, you know, have a review step that kind of circulates it back through for, you know, feedback.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Jim.Forsythe: Me. I push it.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Tony Atchley: Uh… you obviously don't want to slow the process down, but, you know, at the same time, um…

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Tony Atchley: don't want to get it and say, I wish we had done it this way, you know, kind of thing. But Lucinda, uh, Lucinda's kind of a new cog in the wheel.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Tony Atchley: uh, so to speak, they… academics hasn't always had that resource, so I think they…

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Tony Atchley: Recently put her in place within the last year.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Eric Severson: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard about this. And is she part of academics, or is she part of marketing?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Eric Severson: Does she report to academics or marketing? Anybody know?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Tony Atchley: I think she reports to marketing, but, um, but there's dot line… there's dot line some direction, I don't know which.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Jim.Forsythe: Kind of a dotted line to…

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Eric Severson: And guys, I put a headcount in the budget that did not get approved for marketing head for Caroline, and I'm continuing to tell or suggest to Caroline that the.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Eric Severson: the way that we do marketing here feels very parochial. I've come from very large organizations, and it is faster and easier to get stuff done than it seems to be here, and so it definitely.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Eric Severson: Don't see anybody working with a B2B focus on marketing, and I'm continuing to advocate for, how do we do two things?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Eric Severson: AI absolutely should be used for making this a more seamless process.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Eric Severson: Uh, over the weekend, I built landing page generators that I'll show you guys. I know Sherry spent 6 weeks.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Eric Severson: Struggling and arguing with Brittany over getting a basic landing page done.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Eric Severson: And there's no reason for that, absolutely no reason for that, so finding a way to.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Eric Severson: Maybe help educate people about how we deal with these workflows so that they're not so frustrating, they're not so bureaucratic.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Eric Severson: And so that you do have academics involved, but you have somebody that looks at it from a persuasive perspective as well, saying.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Eric Severson: Will this thing meet the objectives of the promotion that we're intending it for? Uh, if that's marketing, great, but at some point, that should be the people that are sitting there making the magic happen.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Eric Severson: That's you guys, right? And so I'm super curious about the process and the workflow.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Eric Severson: Uh, because I think it's an area for CSU to really review and to improve.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and that's why, if you think I'm lost in the weeds in this stuff, that's across the board, I'm looking at.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Eric Severson: How do we go faster in 2026? And marketing comes up, like, over and over and over again.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Eric Severson: 6 weeks for one, 200,000 member, uh…

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Eric Severson: partnership through the American Nursing Association for one.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Eric Severson: landing page is ridiculous. I mean, we're never going to grow effectively if that's the pace.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Eric Severson: That we can… we have to take with this stuff. And so, not being critical, just…

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Jim.Forsythe: By the way, I just forward you an email of those conversations… some of those conversations.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Eric Severson: Perfect. Perfect. Thank you.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Uh, Jim, are you using AI this week?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, what is it again?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Eric Severson: How are you using AI this week?

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Jim.Forsythe: What, what, what is it again?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Eric Severson: At some point…

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Duane Brown: Artificial intelligence.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Eric Severson: At some point, if there's anything I could do to help you with AI, you can count on my enthusiastic support of it, right? So…

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Jim.Forsythe: Okay. Well, I'll tell you what, I do have… I do have a lot of artificial intelligence, but uh… no, I…

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, but just to update you real quick on a couple of things, uh, we had… and this isn't this week, but there's a lot of.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Jim.Forsythe: catch up to do this next week. But, you know, we've been working with Space Florida, uh, and we've made some good contacts there. They're hosting a space day, don't have the exact date yet, so I gotta get that clarified this week.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Jim.Forsythe: get that all set up. Mike is going to be working with Matt Chestnut, who is the Director of Business Development for Space Florida.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Jim.Forsythe: is based out of Titusville, so we kind of divided up. Mike wants to work directly with him, go to maybe some of their events that they have locally. Uh, I've been working with Melissa Stoker.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Jim.Forsythe: And Eric, I think you were on that call, but she's a local rep for the Northwest County. Well, she's just been promoted.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Jim.Forsythe: to all of the regional reps in the state report to her now, and she reports, so they… and I gotta follow up, because just before Christmas, they were down for a…

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Jim.Forsythe: A state meeting in their headquarters, and she was presenting all of our information to all of the regional reps.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Jim.Forsythe: to promote it and get it out there. So… I'm gonna work with her, Mike's gonna work with Matt.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, we also had a follow-up ULA launch.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, which builds all the fuselages, and they build all the missiles, they work with everybody. Blue Horizon, all of that.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, so we're moving forward with that. Uh, Heather Wilson, who is their chief liaison and.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Jim.Forsythe: Community person who's just been elected to the Board of Manufacture Alabama. I'll see her next week.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, she's also been elected to the board of the Huntsville Chamber, so that's a great contact we have there. She's.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Jim.Forsythe: she… Mike and I had a conference call with her recently, and she's very receptive, very open.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, we're also working closely with NextOps, and again, it's going back to marketing. Are you familiar with NextOps?

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Eric Severson: Nope.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Jim.Forsythe: Okay, Mike Perry thought this was a great organization for us to get tied in with, but they work with veterans.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Jim.Forsythe: Next opportunity, think of it that way, and preparing them for future careers as they transition out of the military. They're nationwide.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, we have a great contact here for the state of Alabama, and their office in Alabama is actually based in the Chamber, uh, Huntsville Chamber headquarters building.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Jim.Forsythe: separate operation there, but they want to promote us more. So, we had a conference call with Maddie Zimmerman, who is their marketing person.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Jim.Forsythe: And after a lot of discussion, it ended up where she's going to work directly with Wendy.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, and this is… this is not a criticism, but an example of what you were talking about, Eric.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Jim.Forsythe: I was trying to get some promotional materials for Next Stop for them to take and promote and utilize with their membership and so forth, and promote this space operations program.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Jim.Forsythe: And the initial email I got back was a link to our, uh…

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Jim.Forsythe: our page where we can order brochures and flyers, saying, Jim, just go to here and we can.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Jim.Forsythe: You can order whatever you want that's on the web page.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Jim.Forsythe: So, I thought, well, I know about that, I have that, that's not really what I was looking for.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, so Janelle has taken that on also to come up with a flyer for us.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, and a story, because…

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Jim.Forsythe: I think we can get with all of the chambers, uh, the big ones, Huntsville, Montgomery.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, Mobile, they're all willing to do not… not a press release, but actually a story for us.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, if we write it and give it to them, at no cost.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Eric Severson: And what's the story…

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Eric Severson: What's the story about?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Jim.Forsythe: The story is basically going to be about our new program, and what it has to offer, and how it's on the cutting edge.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Jim.Forsythe: building up CSUs, being on the cutting edge of developing this, and what the careers lead to.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Jim.Forsythe: For them to publish it and show that it's something new and exciting.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Eric Severson: Okay, and so Janelle goes to where for that? Why does… again, I… sorry, that feels like ultimately a marketing content piece.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Eric Severson: And it has to come out of academics, because they're the subject matter experts on this.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, that's your pay grade and not mine.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Okay. Alright.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Eric Severson: Uh, well, let's keep moving on, because we're at time already. So, Duane, what do you got for focus this week?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Tony Atchley: Okay.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Duane Brown: Uh, finishing up, um, the Epley stuff this morning. I started that Friday, getting that renewed. Um, and then the email I sent you, Eric.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Duane Brown: Uh, last week was pertaining to the, uh, all the landing page information that we met about.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Duane Brown: Um, the week you were here. Um, sending that over so I can input that and start getting working on that.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Duane Brown: Um, and throwing some stuff out.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Eric Severson: let's… let me… let me ask you to do one thing, uh, in addition to that. Maybe you were already planning on it, but it's the…

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Eric Severson: Next week, we're together, and I'd like it if you'd come, Duane, and present the benefit strategy.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Duane Brown: Yes, the PowerPoint.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Eric Severson: I think the benefit… the benefit company strategy, there's one document that had 3 points in it, and I think I called it the…

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Eric Severson: Uh, meeting outcomes, or something like that.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, you sent that to Tony and I.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, that… I think that's all we need to talk about, and then, you know, to say…

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Duane Brown: Yep, yep.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Eric Severson: Strategy for 26 wraps around those 3 things and, you know, it's maybe.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Eric Severson: One or two slides showing, here's what we're gonna do for a quarterly review.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Eric Severson: Here's, you know, the points of emphasis, and then you could potentially say, and we're always looking for new, uh, benefit company partners.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Eric Severson: So… and then… and then for me, I'd love it if we could get a conversation with Scholarship America going at some point in the next month or two, right?

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Eric Severson: Just the same discovery, what can we do that's different?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Duane Brown: Got it.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Eric Severson: So, uh, and I'll share with you some of the… certainly the Notebook LM stuff, but some of the other things. Over the weekend, I was just really…

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Eric Severson: plug it away at this… this thing with Sherry in 6 weeks for the American Nursing Association.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Eric Severson: Blows me away, and if we're gonna move more nimbly and quickly around.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Eric Severson: B2B, one of the premises is we've got to be able to shape that offer around B2B, not around… it's an internally focused.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Eric Severson: page, right? Uh, it is ultimately a conversion page for prospects.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Eric Severson: But we need to still be able to do things with those pages that.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Eric Severson: 6 weeks for one page is insane, so…

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Duane Brown: Plus, they have all the… I mean, I'm not downing, you know, marketing, but they have.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Duane Brown: All these landing pages that have already been created.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Duane Brown: And I'll say…

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Eric Severson: So the thing that I'm curious about there is they're created, but I can't find them on the internet. So I have many mapping services.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Eric Severson: that will map out of a comprehensive website, none of those appear. So there's no SEO, there's nothing.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Eric Severson: that tells… you have to know the exact URL, or you can't find them. And I probably made Tony crazy going, where the are the landing page list again?

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Eric Severson: And so, just while we're here together, is there a list so that I can see all… what partners have landing pages, what don't?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Duane Brown: Um, I mean, I can get the list for our companies for business development.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Duane Brown: But as far as… I think it's, uh, isn't it ColumbiaSouthern.com forward slash the company name?

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Duane Brown: If you put that in… no.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Eric Severson: Not always, ANA is sitting in there as American Nursing Association, so you can sit and guess, and is there one for every single learning partner, or only on request?

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Duane Brown: Gotcha. Right.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Tony Atchley: Only on request. Yeah.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Duane Brown: I think only on request, yeah. Yeah, for the learning partner side, yeah.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Eric Severson: Okay. I just want to see a full inventory of where are they, and usually I could find this stuff without having to go ask somebody, but it also means.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Duane Brown: Right.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Eric Severson: no one else can find those things. So why is that? Why would we want to keep them a secret, exactly? Uh, and so there's just a whole raft of marketing issues that I'm starting to get curious about.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Duane Brown: Right.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Eric Severson: But it would really help me if you have a list of those, or can get a list of all of our learning partner landing pages, that would be outstanding, because again, it's not easy, I haven't been able to figure it out.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Duane Brown: Okay. Got it.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Eric Severson: So… Tony, what you got for focus this week?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, I think, you know, so to kind of wrap a number of different conversations here this morning, uh, the landing page piece, um, and the isolation of that, I think, has been.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Tony Atchley: Um, you know, the, um, visibility of those has always been…

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Tony Atchley: kind of, um…

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Tony Atchley: account team giving that to a Signal Mutual, for instance, and having them repurpose that in their world. Um, so, you know, kind of a focused use of that landing page, as opposed to.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Tony Atchley: you know, a broad… a broader reach, a more of an industry reach. So, maybe something that we, you know, definitely want to look into in the future, but.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Tony Atchley: you know, um, the landing page piece, I think, has got to get back to more of a customized.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Tony Atchley: You know, type of approach, and we've got to have some parameters from which we can build around.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Tony Atchley: Some, uh, additional tools that are built into it, uh, just things that really get into that persuasive.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, kind of mindset with it, as opposed to it being, you know, just a static place to go, you know, for navigation.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Tony Atchley: So…

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Eric Severson: And who… is it Brittany Armistead that builds these things? Who builds these things?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, it's, uh, under her team, you know, yeah, but they've really, truly, it's been a template, you know, so all they do each time there's a request.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Tony Atchley: it's basically a name change, uh, establishing a URL, uh, maybe some tracking, uh, things that go into it behind the scenes, but other than that, there's no customization that goes into each of them whatsoever. You know, that's all been.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Eric Severson: No.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Tony Atchley: Established.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Duane Brown: Unless we ask, like, with Epley, you know, the nursing, I mean, it's not… it's still basic.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Duane Brown: But it's… the verbiage has changed, basically. Yeah, yeah.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. Yeah.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Eric Severson: And when did that happen? Did that happen recently?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Eric Severson: Dwayne? With that, please? Last year.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Duane Brown: Oh, last year… no, last year, we did that with that leaf, with… we changed the verbiage for the nursing.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Duane Brown: Uh, partners that Atlay deals with. So it was more of a nursing, yeah.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:31.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, so… I think the landing page strategy for 2026 is exactly the same as the strategy that we use with the benefit companies, right? It's those 3 things.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Eric Severson: differentiation, segmentation, and tracking. Uh, and really, the reason I'm after a list is I want to give.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Eric Severson: I want to make a request of Dale to see the click traffic on these.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Eric Severson: pages. And then, again, I want to.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Eric Severson: gently open up a conversation about, why are these things orphaned pages? Why… shouldn't we have these discoverable by.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Eric Severson: the world, right? Uh, I mean, so what if a non-Signal Mutual member finds the Signal Mutual.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Eric Severson: partner page, it may drive interest anyway, right? Especially if we're highlighting.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Eric Severson: The four maritime safety courses, and how that fits in, and what's in those courses, and…

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Eric Severson: Why you might want to be interested in taking that stuff. And I don't think we want to do this as a.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Eric Severson: one-off, right? It needs to be more of a living thing, and again, for me, without getting off track.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Eric Severson: AI enables so much of this right now. I'm curious to see, is this a policy problem? Is this a tools and awareness problem over in marketing? Or how can I help you guys understand.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Eric Severson: you know…

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Eric Severson: It's not just busy work. We can find a way to, you know, level up the effort here so that you're not.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Eric Severson: Constantly having to do…

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Eric Severson: The burden of, you know.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Tony Atchley: Yep.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Eric Severson: Landing page tweaks.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Tony Atchley: I think the other thing that, you know, we come back to is, uh, you know, the need for the launch kit. Um, you know, and I keep calling it a launch kit, but back to the space ops, you know.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Tony Atchley: We should not be at this point, you know, with that program, and again, it's much like Signal Mutual, where.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Tony Atchley: You know, we've, um, we don't have a out-front opportunity to really begin to build the story, build the, um, the promotion of it.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Tony Atchley: And now, we're all scrambling, you know, after the fact, um, chamber, you know, type opportunities that are here, and we don't have the collateral and the means, you know, to get out there and really start.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Tony Atchley: Um…

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, totally agree.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Tony Atchley: You know, evangelizing it, so, yep.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Eric Severson: Totally agree. Later today, I'm having a meeting with Sherry to go over.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Eric Severson: the space ops plan. Jim, I'm going to add you to that, if you can join. It's an opportunity just to listen, because I'm still trying to figure out.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Eric Severson: Um, how to bring a little bit more…

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Jim.Forsythe: Who's doing… Eric, who's doing the space ops plan?

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Eric Severson: Sherry, so this is the problem right now.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Jim.Forsythe: What are they doing? I don't know anything about it.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Eric Severson: No, neither do I. This is part of the… this is part of the challenge at CSU right now, is everybody's doing everything around certain programs.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Eric Severson: And there's no checklist, there's no formal list of organization, there's none of that stuff. And so, that…

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Eric Severson: does not make my OCD, you know, nerve happy, and so the… I'm trying to figure out.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Eric Severson: what can we own? How can we put together a good plan to follow? It's gotta be simple and a checklist. The thing that I sent out earlier is way too big, I got that, Tony, we've got a.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Eric Severson: bang it down into four executable things with checklists and accountabilities. And then we, Jim, we do need to figure out what's our collaboration model with Sherry and team on this.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Eric Severson: They're probably just talking about going to conferences, but nonetheless, you shouldn't be in the dark about that. Uh, we… we are… Sherry and I are actively looking at how do we.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Eric Severson: Collaborate more effectively, and this is all in that… in the theme of, hey, there's a new program, and it doesn't seem like there's a…

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Eric Severson: clear doc. If it's not written down, I don't think it's real, guys, and you'll hear this from me over and over again. If there's not a written down plan, it's just.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Eric Severson: well-intentioned people doing stuff in the world. That's different than write it down, execute it, check it off, right? And this is one of the areas where a lot of people doing a lot of things, and academics, and business development, and outreach, and I would put it charitably in the.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Eric Severson: well-intentioned, but possibly grabastically disorganized state. And so how do we… how do we think about, uh, a level of organization that is warranted, but not stifling?

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Eric Severson: So then, this is the other thing, and maybe there's a better way to do this, but this makes me crazy of not being able to look at a course and understand when is it offered.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Eric Severson: So, we have part of the website, and I scrape stuff off our website all the time.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Eric Severson: The only place I've found that shows when a course is offered is a little area on the website that I'm sure nobody goes to.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Eric Severson: And so, I did this first for OSH, and you can see… let me make this a tad bigger so you can see what this is.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Eric Severson: So your start dates are across the top here. If there's a 1, it means that course is offered during that period of time.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Eric Severson: So, OSH12301-2305 offered every single term.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Eric Severson: The new course…

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Eric Severson: was offered, uh, October 1, I don't think anybody's in there. The next offering is January 21st.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Eric Severson: Again, this is why, to Tony's point, we should be having a well-organized promotion campaign. I don't really know who's accountable for filling those seats.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Eric Severson: And maybe in a purely online school, it's not that big a deal, but my previous experience would be people get fired.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Eric Severson: Because you've got classroom space, you've got instructors dedicated, if you come up with a goose egg.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Eric Severson: for a course offering date, there was a massive amount of trauma that happened as a result of that. I get it's not the same here, but I also don't feel like there's anybody other than maybe admissions.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Eric Severson: Working to try to figure out who do we get into that course right now? The next one is right after that, 218, and then.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Eric Severson: There's only one more in 527. So, for the new maritime course sequences.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Eric Severson: it's not a… I get now why the urgency is a little lower. We take a very sort of slow approach to building, I guess.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Eric Severson: stuff into this, seeds into this. I think there's a promotion opportunity and an organization opportunity. Jim, I'm gonna invite you to this. I just want you to listen to the… it's Sherry's meeting. I'm glad that we're having it.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Eric Severson: It's gonna include, you know, I hope, what's the MOU look like, what's the conference schedule look like.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Eric Severson: Well, how are we coordinating across all the different parts of the organization? At least it's a start for that. And this, I'm showing you to say, hey, it's not as urgent as I initially thought, because you don't have to fill all these seats, and here's space.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Eric Severson: So, Space Ops…

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Eric Severson: 11.5, I don't think there were very many of anybody that went into Intro to Space Ops.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Eric Severson: I don't think it happened on 12-3 either. The next one isn't till 325.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Eric Severson: So, if the goal is to butts in seats, essentially, which is, of course, the university's goal.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Eric Severson: the next time we have to worry about intro to space operations isn't until March. But, at the same time.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Eric Severson: You've got fundamental orbital mechanics, space domain awareness, space policy and governance, space…

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Eric Severson: Uh, so there's, it's not every, the cadence of offerings is not every single week. I do think that we want to start to invoke.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Eric Severson: specific courses and how, when they're offered, that makes it actionable for people, right? The fact that we have a program is swell. What do you do if you want to get into that, or before that? Why would you want to get into that program? What are the jobs?

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Eric Severson: and the opportunities connected to it, and then at some point, here's the path to doing that. Not just a button on a website that says apply now, but a little bit of information saying, here are the next offerings for this period of time.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Eric Severson: So, Tony, this is, I think, something that we need to go back to Signal with and say, okay, what can we do to try to take aim at, uh, you know, 218.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Eric Severson: 325, 426, to try to figure out, you know, are we promoting with enough urgency to try to get some.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Eric Severson: Some folks to sign up for those things.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Tony Atchley: Mm-hmm, mhm.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Eric Severson: We're 15 minutes over. Uh, is there anything else, Tony, you want to hit, uh, for focus for the week?

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, no, um, just my, uh, AI opportunity, uh, stems back to, uh, last week. So, quick story, I had…

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, fiber optic cable installed in my neighborhood about 90 days ago.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Tony Atchley: Contractor just so happened to cut through my water line in the process of that. They did patch it up, but in the process, on the, uh, service side.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Eric Severson: That's a life-changing experience.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Tony Atchley: I, uh, have discovered a leak.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Tony Atchley: That leak, um, has introduced, um, pressure issues into my house that I started hearing in the very back end.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Tony Atchley: Um… and…

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, you know, started doing some investigation, which led me to the, the, uh, the leak on the source side.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, I've spent, uh, now it's 7 days trying to get the utility company out here to address the leak, to stabilize that.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Tony Atchley: So that I can, um, begin to, you know, backtrack. In the meantime, on New Year's Day.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Jim.Forsythe: Oh.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, in our patio lanai area, I started having water bubble up under my slab.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Duane Brown: Oh, no.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Eric Severson: Oh, boy.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Tony Atchley: So, my whole point in giving you that is AI, uh, I started to build a story.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Tony Atchley: And it gave me a complete roadmap of everything that I need to take to the utility.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Tony Atchley: to take to the AT&T contractor when we get to that point. The insurance call that I've already made to my homeowner's insurance to try to figure out, you know, where to navigate next.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Tony Atchley: And, uh, so, it was very useful from that standpoint, so, uh, you know, just…

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Tony Atchley: Another, uh, another example.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Duane Brown: Wow.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, it's a great example, and I think the way to apply that in a business context.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Tony Atchley: Oh, yeah.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Eric Severson: Is anytime there is a…

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Eric Severson: opportunity to think a little bit differently, to… I like to call it narrowing the distance between idea and execution. So, the work.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Eric Severson: is what narrows the distance between idea and execution. On marketing, it is that instead of just giving them an order, I'd like to start to look at how close can we come to giving them.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Eric Severson: Here's the work, 3 quarters done. Review it, approve it, and let's move forward so it doesn't take 6 weeks.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Eric Severson: on a campaign memo, or follow-up memos, I'm happy to show you guys how to put the context in there, previous emails.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Eric Severson: Uh, if you do get a transcript, transcripts, and then you use it for a thought partner, and it just accelerates. Tony, you probably could have got there through a series of trial and error over weeks and weeks and weeks.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Eric Severson: But it gives you a much better structure to try and implement, and it's fantastic for that. Works well for that, and.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Tony Atchley: Yep.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Eric Severson: You should think about that for all business contexts, too.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Eric Severson: internal collaboration in particular, how do we… how do we improve the level of internal collaboration?

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and often it may be just making sure that you've asked AI, have I thought of everything? Before you hit send.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Eric Severson: have I thought of everything? Give me, you know, the perspective from this person's job, or this person's perspective. And it can act as a sounding board like that.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Eric Severson: Which can help you think of additional thoughts to put in there, or just be sensitive to.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Eric Severson: I always put in there, what questions am I most likely to get asked as a result of this email, right, from this person's perspective.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Eric Severson: And that's usually Dale, and it'll give me a long list of, here's what a CMO at a university, online university, might be interested in or respond to, and it just gives me a little bit more depth of thinking before I get into those conversations with them, so…

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Eric Severson: Okay, good. Anything, uh, this week, I am working on the strategy for 26 and the deck for next week.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Eric Severson: Um, Jim, if you could help me if you'd send me a one-page.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Eric Severson: Here are the priorities that you see for 26, high level, that you're focused on. Uh, I'd like to include that as part of the overall slide, just as an update for that.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and Jim, are you coming in next week for that?

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Jim.Forsythe: Yeah, I've, uh, on, uh…

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Jim.Forsythe: Tuesday, the 13th, I'm going to Montgomery. Uh, it's the Manufacture Alabama Legislative Reception.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Eric Severson: Right.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Jim.Forsythe: That evening, and so a lot… all the politicians come in, they're getting ready to start their legislative session, but all the.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Jim.Forsythe: Big manufacturing corporations are also there, so those are the people that I like to meet.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Jim.Forsythe: And I just sent Tony an email a while ago, I'm getting meetings set up. I let people know that I was going to be coming up there, and so far, Hyundai Mobus.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, I don't know if you're familiar with them or not, but Mobus is the Hyundai division that manufactures the batteries for EV vehicles.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Jim.Forsythe: They're all separate entities, and they've asked me to, as long as I'm in town, to stop by for a meeting and.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Jim.Forsythe: visit with them for a while. Then I've also gotten a request from Hyundai Transformers. They build all the huge… they're not affiliated with motors at all. They build all the huge transformers that go.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Jim.Forsythe: On, like, uh, cruise ships, Navy vessels for electrical power.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Jim.Forsythe: these things are the size of a train car, and so, uh, uh, Tony Wojo, we call him, is the HR guy there. We've gotten to be good friends over the years, and…

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Jim.Forsythe: His daughter's in our MBA program, and uh… so I'm gonna be going there.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Eric Severson: Jim, if you wouldn't mind, I would love to hear about their staffing plans, right? How are they doing?

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Eric Severson: Are they able to find enough local talent? Are they able to find the jobs and fill the jobs that they want?

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Eric Severson: Especially at that lower level, right? We're not talking about the credential jobs, but the…

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Jim.Forsythe: Mm-hmm.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Eric Severson: The entry-level stuff, just to see, you know, hey, is this a problem for your organization or not?

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, Jim, at the appropriate time, uh, you know, with this CTR relationship, they've got a, uh, they've got initiatives in the automotive space as well, so they've already got.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Tony Atchley: connections at, um, Mercedes-Benz, um…

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Eric Severson: BMW.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:09.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, and BMW, so, uh, Hyundai's gonna be a natural extension of that, you know, at some point when we, you know, when we get to that point.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Tony Atchley: Um, I don't know if you guys saw it, but 60 Minutes had a piece on.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, the Hyundai plant over near Savannah, Jim, uh, yesterday. Yeah, yeah, really, uh, really…

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Jim.Forsythe: Yeah, I saw it.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Tony Atchley: Interesting, uh, where that's going from the labor force standpoint.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Jim.Forsythe: Are you guys aware that we are working with BMW?

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Eric Severson: in what way? We've got a learning partnership, you mean?

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Jim.Forsythe: Not yet, it's in the works.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Eric Severson: Who is working that?

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh… actually, huh?

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Eric Severson: Who's working that? Is that you, or who is working that?

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Jim.Forsythe: Yeah, yeah. Well, if you want to take us out, I'll just tell you really what happened.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Eric Severson: Great.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, whenever, uh…

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, Amy Ross came on board. In her introduction, it said she used to work for BMW.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Jim.Forsythe: So I called her up that day and told her I was coming by the next day to meet her, and uh…

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Jim.Forsythe: So I went over there, and she gave… it ended up, she worked for a lot of the executives over there.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Jim.Forsythe: So, I provided her with some information, and she put me in touch with the right person.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, and he actually came, so I had a conference call with him, and Amy joined us, we had a conference call, went over the MOU, went through everything.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Jim.Forsythe: He said he likes to visit any places, so he actually… he and his wife, who actually works… he's over training and development, his wife works in HR, and they drove over to the space operations introduction we had at Columbia Southern.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Jim.Forsythe: And Caroline set them up at the, uh, hotel where you stay, and they came in and did some sightseeing and attended the event.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Jim.Forsythe: And it's just kind of going through… he sent me an email before the holiday saying it was going to be a priority, but…

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Jim.Forsythe: It's going through the process of a bureaucracy to put an MOU together with them, so I don't know if you were aware of that or not, but…

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Eric Severson: And what's… what is the… is it BMW's desire to change the MOU, or is it stuck somewhere with us?

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Jim.Forsythe: It's nowhere, it's just going through the approval process of a bureaucracy.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Jim.Forsythe: nobody's requested any kind of changes, they just have our standard MOU, and so far, nobody's said anything about it, it's just that there's a…

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Jim.Forsythe: A process they have to go through for approval.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Duane Brown: Up the chain of command, like our stuff that we get from the companies.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Jim.Forsythe: Yeah, and I've also found out that.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Jim.Forsythe: whether it be Hyundai, BMW, anybody, if they're a foreign-owned company.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Jim.Forsythe: Uh, like at Hyundai, a lot of things happen, but until somebody with a Korean name signs off on it, it's not official.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Eric Severson: Well, very exciting.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Jim.Forsythe: But I just want to let you know we are working with BMW, and have been for a couple of months.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Eric Severson: Very good.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Eric Severson: Oh, good. No, that's… that's awesome. And again, I think this…

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Eric Severson: New… the discovery there would be…

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Eric Severson: at some point, to ask about, uh, the CTR relationship.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Eric Severson: And, you know, and as this… as our relationship with CTR develops, it'll be curious to hear.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Eric Severson: Because, again, if they're doing a big business with CTR.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Eric Severson: if CTR's partnership with CSU outsources the.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Eric Severson: Online education will begin to pick up.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Eric Severson: revenue from BMW.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Eric Severson: hires or trainees. And it's just important to know about that as you're going into it, and say, you know, just to hear.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Eric Severson: what level of the BMW business is this? Do they care about this very much? You know, tell us about how that's all gone. So we've got another set of eyes and ears.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Eric Severson: from a customer perspective on a CTR relationship. The CTR and signal mutual relationship's a big deal.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Eric Severson: Uh, for the shipbuilding industry. The CTR-CSU relationship could be a very big deal for expanding into a completely new revenue source.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and it's… it's hitting a lot of major employers already. And so I'm just super curious to hear.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Eric Severson: As that comes up, it's really the broader conversation about how's your staffing plan? You know, do you have trouble filling your entry-level positions? What are the ways that you go about doing that?

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Eric Severson: You know, hey, are you hiring anybody, putting them through a short-term training program? How's that working? All that stuff, so…

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Eric Severson: we're way over, guys. So, uh, thank you for the time and attention. Again, I'm around this week. I'll try to get Wednesday, the deck out to everybody, and Duane, you and I can schedule time tomorrow.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Duane Brown: Okay. Quick question. As a team, what are we doing next week for the team thing?

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Eric Severson: Tomorrow afternoon, okay. Yep.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Eric Severson: Oh, so I did not get a, uh… I think you're on your own for the team.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Eric Severson: costume, I've heard she likes it, right? And so, I did not execute on a baseball theme. I have sitting in my closet.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Duane Brown: Nope.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Duane Brown: Ha!

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Eric Severson: enough, uh, Formula One wear, so that…

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Duane Brown: There you go, okay.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Eric Severson: The way that I see this, hoping to see this thing fall out, is that you've got 2 or 3 talking points for why you've got the uniform one that you've got for the team.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and… it's either that, or it'd be too hard for us to all come up with a single team.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Duane Brown: For the team, yeah.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Duane Brown: Right, no, no.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Eric Severson: I find the three of you want to stay with a baseball theme, that… because it's easy, that's great. I would just think about one or two.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Eric Severson: talking points of why the team is important and how it might apply to CSU.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Eric Severson: Right? Super high level.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Duane Brown: Then I'll… then I'll just wear a jersey, then. I'm not going full board pants and everything.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Eric Severson: Well, if you have it, if you have it, I think that there's, uh, there's, uh, you know, spirit and motivation points, Duane. So, I'll be coming in a full-bore thing, right? Just because I get it, there's spirit and motivation points for that.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Duane Brown: Nope.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Duane Brown: So you have the full, like, NASCAR body driver suit.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Eric Severson: Uh…

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Eric Severson: Well, no, I have the uniform that they wear outside of the car, but all that is, is a jersey, a hat, and black pants. I got that, I got that covered, so…

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Duane Brown: Ha!

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Duane Brown: Tony, what are you wearing?

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Tony Atchley: I, uh…

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, I'm gonna come with the, um, workforce development, uh…

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Tony Atchley: Safety industry, uh, kind of approach to, um…

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Tony Atchley: Skills building.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Tony Atchley: So, uh, I will… I will be, uh, garbed with a hard hat and, uh, various… various look to support that.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Duane Brown: Got it.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Eric Severson: Awesome. Yeah.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Duane Brown: Got it. There you go.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Eric Severson: Safety vest, all that stuff, big boots, steel toad.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Tony Atchley: That's it.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Jim.Forsythe: That's on Tuesday only, right?

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Eric Severson: I don't know when that is. I just says blocked out for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Tony, how does that typically go?

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Jim.Forsythe: Oh, well, I thought… I thought I saw an email about the costume was on Tuesday.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Eric Severson: I missed that. If you did, send it to me, please.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Jim.Forsythe: If the kicker off.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Tony Atchley: Well, no… no, I haven't… I guess we'll see the agenda coming out today, uh, you know, with more details, but I think Tuesday, we're, um…

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Tony Atchley: uh, we're not coming together as a group until Wednesday, right?

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Duane Brown: I think so.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Eric Severson: I didn't know, I just have…

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Jim.Forsythe: Well, I don't know, I thought it was Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I don't know.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Eric Severson: That's… on my calendar, it's Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, blocked off.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Duane Brown: I think I saw that too, Tony.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, well, I think we're… the, uh, management is coming together on Tuesday was the last I heard before the holidays, so…

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Duane Brown: There was an email, I think. I remember reading that.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Jim.Forsythe: Alright.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Jim.Forsythe: Well, I'll be driving back from Montgomery Wednesday morning, and if there's something, I'll be there Wednesday and Thursday.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Duane Brown: Wearing his CSU polo.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Jim.Forsythe: There you go.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Eric Severson: Well, you guys have… you guys have…

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Jim.Forsythe: I got a… I got a Makos hat.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Eric Severson: Okay, I mean, I would go with…

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Duane Brown: Hey, something… something's better than nothing.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Jim.Forsythe: That's a high school, that's an Orange Beach high school mascot, the makeup.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Eric Severson: I think it's… I think that's a fair thing, although if there's a way…

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Eric Severson: to link it into your priorities. And so, from my perspective, your priorities are local.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Eric Severson: local workforce development, right, Jim? And so, is there a local baseball team would be fine with that, right?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Duane Brown: There you go.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Jim.Forsythe: Well, that's what the Makos are, they're the high school.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Jim.Forsythe: It's the Orange Beach High School Mikos.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Eric Severson: Perfect.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Duane Brown: It's local.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Eric Severson: It's local.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Duane Brown: There you go.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Tony Atchley: I got a… I got a blue Wahoo's hat if you need it.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Duane Brown: I was gonna ask you about… I was gonna say, are you coming decked out in blue water?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Eric Severson: Perfect. Alright guys, thank you. Have a good rest of the day.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Duane Brown: That's awesome. Okay. Yes, sir.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Tony Atchley: Alright.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Jim.Forsythe: Hey, what time is that meeting?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Eric Severson: We'll find out probably in this next meeting. We'll make sure that it's clear that we need a…

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Eric Severson: A start and end schedule, so…

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Jim.Forsythe: No, I'm in with Jerry. What time is that?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Eric Severson: Uh…

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Eric Severson: Oh, that is at…

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Eric Severson: 1 o'clock, and I cannot forge you that meeting, uh, she's got that locked down.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Eric Severson: So, it's me, Caroline, and Sherry. So, I'll take meeting notes and send you the meeting notes from that.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Jim.Forsythe: I was gonna say, I can contact Sherry and have her include me, if you want.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, why don't you contact her and ask her if it's, if it's something that you, that, uh.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Eric Severson: she thinks you should be part of. I know at a high level, we're trying to work out more frequent collaboration, and one of the things we're doing is just having a regular Monday meeting with three of us.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Jim.Forsythe: Alright.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Eric Severson: And so, it may be just about that. Uh, so…

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Jim.Forsythe: Okay.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Jim.Forsythe: Okay.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Duane Brown: Happy New Year, by the way, everybody.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Happy New Year, indeed.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Eric Severson: Alright.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Jim.Forsythe: 2, or…

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Eric Severson: So, Jim, if you want to reach out to Sherry and ask about that, it's a Zoom Meeting chat about space, and there's no other details about that.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Jim.Forsythe: Oh, okay.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Eric Severson: Okay, thanks guys.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Jim.Forsythe: Alright, bye.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Eric Severson: Bye-bye.
