00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Jennifer LeeHooper: Good morning.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Eric Severson: Hey, good morning, Jennifer. I don't remember if I mentioned this to you when I was darkening your doorstep, but prior to meeting you, I had reached out to Sonya.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Eric Severson: Saying, hey, curious about having a quick conversation about this, so…

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Eric Severson: That was the genesis for all this.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Jennifer LeeHooper: Oh, wonderful.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Sonya Kopp: Hey, Eric!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Eric Severson: Sonya, how are you today?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Sonya Kopp: I'm alright, thanks.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Sonya Kopp: Alright, so…

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Jennifer LeeHooper: Okay.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Sonya Kopp: What did you want to chat with us about?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Eric Severson: So, uh, when… I have a…

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Eric Severson: experience at a for-profit trade school, Universal Technical Institute, where.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Eric Severson: I was the head of admissions, and we had a fair amount of iterations every time we wanted to do a.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Eric Severson: marketing brochure, landing page revision, going through… we had a marketing contact, and then things would go through legal compliance as well.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Eric Severson: And I just remember that being a process that had a lot of.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Eric Severson: education potential for my team. We were, uh, caught in these iterations where we would submit things, requests, and they would get pushed back.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Eric Severson: And it would go through a very long process, with several iterations, getting to.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Eric Severson: what UTI considered compliant, uh, copy. And, uh, since then, I've spent a couple of years working as an AI consultant.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Eric Severson: And I was just super curious to see… I now, as a business development guy at CSU, I'm looking at wanting to revise a bunch of landing pages for our learning partners.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Eric Severson: And I'm already seeing a little bit of, not friction, but a little bit of iteration when we ask for marketing flyers or tools.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Eric Severson: And I just wanted to ask about, you know, the perspective on using AI as a way to help people submit.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Eric Severson: Close to compliant, ready, uh, copy.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Eric Severson: Has that been a conversation or a topic or anything you guys have thought about?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Sonya Kopp: It has, um, we've… we've worked hard talking with, um…

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Sonya Kopp: the marketing to develop… to develop something. I don't know where they are on that.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Sonya Kopp: Which is one of the reasons I suggested looping in marketing in this.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Sonya Kopp: Um, but yeah, it has been a conversation, um, so that…

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Sonya Kopp: That first review could be done by…

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Sonya Kopp: AI after we have loaded everything in.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Uh, and who in marketing are you working with, or could I reach out to? Certainly, Dale, I know Dale, but is it Brittany Armistead or Brittany, uh, BG?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Sonya Kopp: It would be with Dale and BG, I'm not exactly sure, but I think…

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Sonya Kopp: Connor?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Sonya Kopp: Maze was the person that was working on that, but like I said, I don't know where that lies right now.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Eric Severson: Mm-hmm.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Um, well, I'll go ahead and… I have something, because of the prior experience and me just wondering, is this a way to…

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Eric Severson: start to educate my team, me, Tony, and Dwayne on this process.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Eric Severson: Uh, happy to run that through you if you'd like to see it or have an idea about how it works, or I can just go talk to BG and Dale to say, hey, is this…

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Eric Severson: Is this the kind of thing you're thinking about? Can I help you with this?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Sonya Kopp: I'd be happy to, you know, to have a conversation with all of us. I would, you know, I would prefer to have.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Sonya Kopp: group meetings, as opposed to multiple, multiple, multiple meetings. Just have everybody in the same conversation.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Eric Severson: Totally makes sense. So, I'll go ahead and connect with those guys, and if they've already got something that they're.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Eric Severson: they're done and they're working on, great. Uh, I know this is a…

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Eric Severson: Uh, something that I…

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Eric Severson: want to try to help reduce the friction on and educate my team on, so, you know, I'll sort it out with those guys.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Sonya Kopp: Tell me… tell me about what you mean by the friction.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Eric Severson: multiple iterations, delays on request to completion, you know, making that as tight as possible. And again, these are things that…

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Eric Severson: I've encountered a little bit here, not nearly as much as at UTI. At Universal Technical Institute, it would take 3 to 4 iterations, and that would take something that might be weeks and turn it into months.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Eric Severson: And part of it is, you know, making sure that I get enough lead time squared away with my team, but then… then educating my team as to what you can say and why and why not, and then, again, reducing the number of iterations, mostly from my team through.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Eric Severson: the compliance process.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Sonya Kopp: So, we do typically do, um, compliance training with every department every year, and your team has been through it.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Sonya Kopp: A couple of times.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Eric Severson: Mm-hmm.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Sonya Kopp: Um…

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Sonya Kopp: I will also just tell you, just part of it is…

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Sonya Kopp: At CSU, we work very lean.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Sonya Kopp: Right? So there is…

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Sonya Kopp: A limited number of people who are reviewing that information.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Sonya Kopp: For all the things that are coming through, both in marketing and in our team.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Sonya Kopp: Oh…

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Sonya Kopp: So, just, just as a, you know…

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, no, I've experienced the staffing model here, I've been here for about 6 months, and thought.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Eric Severson: Especially given the leanness, making sure that the stuff that my team puts into the front end of the approval process is as.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Eric Severson: you know, close to approval ready as possible just makes it easier for us to, you know, operate in a lean environment. That's really what I was thinking about here, is.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Eric Severson: How do I reduce the time from request to completion?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Eric Severson: So…

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Sonya Kopp: Yeah, I mean, I would… I would also recommend that until this is.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Sonya Kopp: You know, until we've had this meeting, if you guys have anything.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Sonya Kopp: send it to us first. I will promise… I can almost 100% guarantee that we will look at it faster and move it through more quickly.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Sonya Kopp: So that then whatever you submit to marketing, you can say has already been through.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Eric Severson: That'd be fantastic. That'd be fantastic.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Sonya Kopp: compliance.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Eric Severson: That was really it.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Sonya Kopp: But they have… they have, um… we just did a review of an entire spreadsheet.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Sonya Kopp: Of superlatives and things like that, that we have reviewed, so that's what we try to do with them, is approve a lot of stuff up front, so that every time they're.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Sonya Kopp: Updating something, it doesn't have to come back to us.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, totally get it, and I think this would be…

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Eric Severson: I mean, I've seen things like the brand standards and guidelines and the accepted phrases, and those are good source documents to start to use.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Eric Severson: in that AI model, so it would take the copy, and it would check it against.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Eric Severson: Of course, all the DOE regs, all the, you know, uh, Consumer Fraud Protection Bureau, the… all of those, uh, plus then the CSU standards on top of that.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Eric Severson: And again, the…

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Eric Severson: What I'm envisioning is a quick audit that tells my guys, here's… gives it a, you know, red, yellow.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Eric Severson: Green assessment, and it gives them the, here's why, if it's yellow or red.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Eric Severson: why that might be a concern, and here's how you might want to fix it. So…

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Sonya Kopp: Is your team going to be developing their own content? Like, that stuff's not going through marketing anymore?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Eric Severson: Well, no, I think when we make… have you ever seen a marketing request form?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Eric Severson: the marketing… yeah, so that's where I'm envisioning the… my team will…

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Sonya Kopp: Sure.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Eric Severson: check before they put into that, here's what we're after, right? And again, it is to reduce the number of iterations with a very small lean team in marketing as a way to try to get.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Eric Severson: Our specification nailed down, both visually and then from a, hey, we've run this through compliance, here, a checker at least.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Eric Severson: Here's the, you know, either the audit, or here's the tool itself, and…

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Eric Severson: used to be you could buy these tools, but they're between 20 and 50 grand, and I know at UTI we looked at several different, uh, tools like that, and.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Eric Severson: never really committed because they were enterprise-wide, they were very expensive. So we had one guy who was.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Eric Severson: in marketing who was educated on compliance, and that poor guy was the bottleneck for all of the inbound.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Eric Severson: The poor man's life was miserable, and…

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Eric Severson: really slowed everything down. And at that time, we did do the compliance training, of course, we did it twice a year, and we even had a…

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Eric Severson: you know, an online course that we were taking at UTI for that, but…

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Eric Severson: It didn't seem to sink in to my marketing and admissions team members.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Eric Severson: when they were making requests for promotions, flyers, things like that. And so, by bringing it a little closer.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Eric Severson: To the actual work process. Uh, and again, I haven't… I've experienced, sort of.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Eric Severson: long delays in getting stuff done, but I haven't really experienced, uh, and I'm imagining that part of that is compliance checking.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Eric Severson: Because it always gets edited a little bit. So, helping educate my free guys, and maybe the outreach team in general.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Eric Severson: here's how to reduce the… again, I'm going to call it friction. I don't mean it to be disparaging. I absolutely get that we keep our tuition costs down by running lean.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Eric Severson: And so, what can I do on that inbound to make sure that we're providing stuff that is.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Eric Severson: You know, requires minimal level of effort, easy to review, and then, you know, secondarily educates my team so that they understand how to do it every time they're submitting stuff.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Eric Severson: So it's really geared toward that marketing form that we are asked to fill out to make sure that what goes in there is as close to compliant as possible.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Sonya Kopp: Okay, I mean, I just, as I said, I know that marketing brought something to us previously, so…

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Sonya Kopp: I'm happy to, the two of us, the three of us, to get in a meeting with Dale and BG and see where that is.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, great. And again, what changes it for me at this moment is the $20,000 to $50,000 expense for an enterprise-wide tool.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Sonya Kopp: This was something that they were creating.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Eric Severson: yeah, that's… AI has enabled, this whole new thing, so… Okay. Well, great. Well, I appreciate the few minutes.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Sonya Kopp: Alright.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Eric Severson: Uh, good to see you again, Jennifer. Thank you very much.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Sonya Kopp: Thanks, Eric.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Eric Severson: Yep, bye guys.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Sonya Kopp: Bye.
