00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Eric Severson: Okay, can you hear me?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Tom Malek: Yes and yes, yes and yes.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Um, so…

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Eric Severson: This is one of the things I'm trying to finish off for her this week.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Eric Severson: In Salesforce, her primary…

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Eric Severson: um, reporting mechanism is around events, and she does a weekly event planner and an after-action report in Salesforce.com. It's the primary thing.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Eric Severson: That the outreach team uses to manage their information, okay?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Eric Severson: And this is a complete dump from 2020 to 2025 of the after-action rod data.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Eric Severson: The thing that is so challenging about this is here, you will see.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Tom Malek: Nice.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Eric Severson: that they have…

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Eric Severson: embedded. There's no reference information here.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Eric Severson: So, it's almost as though if you were sitting in a CRM.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Tom Malek: Oh yeah, I'm used to using this. Yeah.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. So… they tried to tell me that ad code.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Eric Severson: is generic to the events, it is not. They tried to tell me a bunch of different stuff that I kept going in here.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Eric Severson: And finding, it is not. So I'm like, Caroline, I think you do want to get to the point where you can.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Eric Severson: She just gave raw numbers. I'm like, Caroline, is that good news or bad news? And she just looked at me, she didn't know.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Eric Severson: I'm like, let me help you with this. I think this is something that you might want to see.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Eric Severson: Uh, Sherry thinks it's all bullshit. She thinks that her managers can manage it with their reps.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Eric Severson: This is fucking adoption tracking, Tom. This is no different than all of the lessons learned about.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Tom Malek: Mm-hmm, yes, correct, right.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Eric Severson: If you don't provide management insight or oversight.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Eric Severson: what are you doing? Well, we handle that on a one-on-one basis. You have 4 brand new managers. How do you know that they know how to give that information out, and then spreading silence.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Tom Malek: Yes, I think… yeah.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Eric Severson: Well, and so, what I've got…

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Eric Severson: Here…

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Eric Severson: is I cleaned it up, and, you know, and again, only because I'm stubborn did I sit down.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Eric Severson: and clean up all their And right away.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Eric Severson: They have a 4% lead…

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Eric Severson: Gen… drop off.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Eric Severson: Fewer leads this year by 4% than last year.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Eric Severson: Is that good news or bad news? I don't know yet, but that was the first thing. Did you know that? No, I did not know that.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Tom Malek: That's terrible news.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Eric Severson: Now, this is by program area.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Eric Severson: By year. 25 is green.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Tom Malek: Yep, that's what I was saying.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Eric Severson: Look at that, from…

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Eric Severson: That's big in fire. That's big in OSH.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Eric Severson: Up in CJ…

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Eric Severson: Here we have two new disciplines, nursing and education.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Tom Malek: Yes. Yeah.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Eric Severson: HR, I don't know why it went up, I don't even know what HC is, it's down. Blank is too much, that's.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Eric Severson: hygiene. This is academic partnerships, no, and learning partnerships.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Tom Malek: HC is healthcare information.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Eric Severson: Healthcare. I don't know how that's different than nursing, do you?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Tom Malek: No.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Eric Severson: So…

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Tom Malek: But I'm guessing because Natalie Azell is the leader of nursing and healthcare, and that's the only thing on here that's HC.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Eric Severson: we can look at this by program and owner, so that you could… or you could look at it by owner. I mean, once you get the data so that you can.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Eric Severson: Manipulated, you can look at it 55 different ways.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Eric Severson: Here's your blitzes, right? So, look at the difference in blitzes. 713 in 2024.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Tom Malek: Yeah. Yep.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Eric Severson: to 180 leads in 2025. So, they didn't do blitzes in 2025.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Eric Severson: Of course, there's always that data hygiene thing. And so, again, she has said very positive things to me. Here is by person.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Eric Severson: I wondered, is this across the board, or is this because you've promoted a bunch of new leaders.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Eric Severson: in the middle of the year, and you took your strongest lead gen people and made them managers, where it's gonna be a year where you, you know, train them up. What is it? And she had no idea about any of this stuff.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Tom Malek: Yes. Yeah.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Eric Severson: So, here's a good example. Teresa is a, you know, she's a new manager.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Eric Severson: That's last year, this is this year. There's a huge drop-off in lead gen.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Eric Severson: For, uh, Natalie, there's a little drop off, not a huge, but a little one.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Eric Severson: We add data labels in here, it'll be a little easier to see what they were. Add data labels.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, so, I mean, Teresa dropped in half, 729 to 382.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Eric Severson: Uh, Renee Wright, almost in half, 502 to 398.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Eric Severson: Where's Ernie? Ernie, of course, 1,200 to $1,000. Still, Ernie's, you know, Ernie's a workhorse, man.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Eric Severson: Uh, Kim Smith, 1100 to 815. There are a bunch of them here that are down. A couple of new ones in here.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Tom Malek: Is it because they split them out and made new territories, and now it's getting… but then you would see, like, other people.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Eric Severson: So…

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Tom Malek: That's very… And then is it… are you looking at it year to… I mean, are the year-to-date things correct?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Eric Severson: You… you're in the new one, so, Henry…

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Tom Malek: That's… this is all, like, likely to be true, though. That looks… that's probably accurate.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I mean, that's the year-to-date thing is, well.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Eric Severson: Uh, yeah, and so then…

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Tom Malek: He froze.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Eric Severson: Education and nursing are up, yeah. So, this then gets to…

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Eric Severson: maybe that's good news. So a 4% decline in leads might not be bad news, right? It's certainly something you should know.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Eric Severson: And you should know why, so you have a story for that.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Tom Malek: But, you know, I guess there, again, it's like, if…

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Tom Malek: These seem so slight, like, if you saw giant whiffs, like, potentially.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Tom Malek: fire… well, maybe there was a conference that didn't happen yet, or the conference was delayed. Like, last year it was, like, the second week of January, and this year it got moved to the first week of February.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Tom Malek: I don't know, I mean, I'm used to working with you with data, and, like, the first thing that we do, typically, is go ahead and try to shoot holes in it, because the first thing someone's gonna do is at us about how it's not right.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Eric Severson: Uh, from $44.90 to 29?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Eric Severson: Well, so, but this is just out of Salesforce, which we own 100%, so if it's not right.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Eric Severson: the only thing you can point at is data maintenance and hygiene, right? And there is some of that, for sure.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Tom Malek: Correct, yeah. But that's okay. If I were a manager, I would like to know that somebody didn't update their work, or that it's a problem like that, versus being down.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Eric Severson: Alright, so right now, Sherry's got it all undercover and says, trust me, they know what they're doing. I'm like, okay, fine, but, you know, that's not an excuse for not having insight.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Tom Malek: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Eric Severson: or potentially oversight as a management team. And let's say that that 4% overall decline in lead gen isn't necessarily bad. The next level that I was gonna look at.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Tom Malek: Mm-hmm.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Eric Severson: Is, look, if you're giving… in education and nursing.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Eric Severson: Are… are we…

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Eric Severson: Focused on lead gen for undergrad, or disproportionately for grad?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Tom Malek: Time period for this.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Eric Severson: Because if you're replacing…

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Eric Severson: leads that were driving graduate or undergrad degrees in FIR with graduate degrees in education and nursing, you're going to be net ahead.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Eric Severson: Right? So that's the next cut of this, would be to say, I suspect this is all about the year of transformation, where they elevated and specialized.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Eric Severson: the teams. And you took probably.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Tom Malek: Yes, and I would say, too, like, it looks like a zero-sum gain of the amount of people resources you have, that's where your leads are going to come from.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Eric Severson: Correct.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Tom Malek: So, are the nursing and education programs that you're selling more expensive and lead to more revenue than fire? Otherwise, you probably should have left them in fire, because you make more money.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Eric Severson: Correct! Correct. And the other question is, is this a one-year adjustment while the team gets up to speed, or is it going to stay like this? And OSHA's probably.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Tom Malek: Yeah, especially if they pulled people away to assign them something else. Yeah. These are all good questions that…

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Eric Severson: Correct. But the fact is, they're not having… the fact is, they're not having any of these conversations, and that's where I think.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Eric Severson: That's why I keep doing this, to say, so there are some underlying things that I would like them to, hey, let me get to this point where Caroline can consume it.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Tom Malek: They've never done it.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Tom Malek: Mm-hmm.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and then I've spent a little bit more time with the underlying, you know, assumptions.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Tom Malek: Yep.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Eric Severson: The thing I want to get them to do is to say, look, I fixed this for you.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Eric Severson: Now I want you to fix it in…

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Eric Severson: This is an ongoing cluster of a high magnitude.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Tom Malek: Yeah, you gotta go in and, like, normalize the data, put it in the right labels, give it all the right naming, yeah.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Eric Severson: Right? I want you guys to…

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Tom Malek: You know what you need, Eric? You need a glossary.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Eric Severson: I've done that, but I'm not doing… I've done that one time for the entire history.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Eric Severson: Yes, Exactly. But the problem is, every day they add to this, it up the data set, because there… there's all of these that are pink are my work.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Tom Malek: Yes, of course. Yeah.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Eric Severson: Look at all the cleaning and normalizing that's going on here. That's a of work. What they need to do is fix Salesforce, so the first thing you pick.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Eric Severson: Is the generic instance of the… of the event.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Eric Severson: Then you can customize it with the rest of this. This is super Bush League.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Tom Malek: I don't think you heard me.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Eric Severson: To be compounding it all together like that, and it just simply prevents you from doing.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Tom Malek: Can you hear me? Are you there?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Eric Severson: What, what?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Tom Malek: I… you were going for a long time. I said… I said you need… you need to create a glossary.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Eric Severson: Are we… are we stuck?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Eric Severson: I am here.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Eric Severson: Hello.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Tom Malek: Can you hear me?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Eric Severson: I can hear you, can you hear me?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Tom Malek: you know?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Tom Malek: Sometimes you were getting a little choppy, that's why I tried to stop you. Plus, you didn't laugh when I said you need to create a glossary.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Eric Severson: Really?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Eric Severson: No, no, I heard it. I heard it.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Tom Malek: Yeah, so what I was saying, you go back to that graph that you had that showed all of that, like, what I want underneath it is, like, what I would call the total addressable market, so it's like, how many nurses, like.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Tom Malek: Because you could say, credibly, you could say with fire, you… this is… this is a marketplace that is operating with the most legacy and the most, um…

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Tom Malek: efficiency. Like, you seem to know everybody, you've been to every conference, like, how are you going to grow that? You don't necessarily need more resources there, but you don't want to diminish your resources too much, because you can't afford to have the leads go down. It's a big… it's a profit center for you.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Tom Malek: And then, with the OSH programs, it's like, what are you missing? Are there safety organizations or places that would consume safety programs? You mentioned one earlier with, uh…

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Tom Malek: uh, heavier industry. Uh, Huntington Ingalls would be a good one.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Tom Malek: And so I'd like, you know, with education, like, what's the strategy? And then, do they have one?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Tom Malek: Nursing is pretty clear, you just signed the ANA. That is… that is huge!

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Tom Malek: Because of the potential that it has.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Eric Severson: Only if something happens.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Tom Malek: Only if something happens. I don't see anything happening. There's nothing happening.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Eric Severson: Only if something actively happens.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Tom Malek: you know, you're squabbling over, like, getting a webpage built. How can you… how can you do outreach to, like, the biggest total addressable market?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Eric Severson: Nope.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Tom Malek: And then for you, it frees you up to, like, okay, what can you pull in? Like, can you get enough contacts in space to, like, have that covered by one of the…

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Tom Malek: One of these managers.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Eric Severson: Right. So, for me, it's still…

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Tom Malek: And then, especially with the… with the, uh, that you're doing with NCCER and that…

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Tom Malek: whatever, 8, 8…

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Tom Malek: A CT.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Eric Severson: ADTC. American Diesel Training Center.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Tom Malek: ADTC.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Tom Malek: CRTC RT.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Eric Severson: 8, well, them, them two. That got…

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Tom Malek: For CTR.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Eric Severson: That got… we had a meeting with them last week where…

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Eric Severson: The academics got anxious about…

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Eric Severson: The.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Eric Severson: Of course.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Eric Severson: The issue there became…

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Eric Severson: What do we do about the.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Eric Severson: Community college relationship.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Eric Severson: So…

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Eric Severson: Well, I'll send this to you. You can, you know, use this not in an addressable market way.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Eric Severson: I mean, honestly, they should be looking at…

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Eric Severson: And this is Sherry, and so I'm not gonna get in the way of this. I mean, look, they've clearly figured out how to start new.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Eric Severson: Programs in education and nursing.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Eric Severson: I do think that with two guys, Eric and Tony, you don't really need us in something like education.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Eric Severson: Education is super easy to figure out, right? There's a structure that is visible and clear.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Eric Severson: To every state and every county and every city. You… this education is the ultimate.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Eric Severson: You need bodies to cover the events, period. I think nursing is similar. It's not hard to figure out the organization of healthcare.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Eric Severson: Space is different. There's no unifying place, and there's a.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Eric Severson: Confusion of military, civilian. This is where…

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Tom Malek: And there's only so many companies.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Eric Severson: Correct, and this is where Eric and Tony can be much more useful. Education and nursing is largely about geography, right? Because there are.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Eric Severson: Schools and hospitals everywhere, predictably. Aerospace does not have that same.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Eric Severson: You know, underlying assumption. You gotta go figure out where is it, exactly.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Eric Severson: That's useful for Eric and Tony, not education. Now, that doesn't mean education isn't a big upside, and this is one of the things.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Eric Severson: I wanted to get to with Caroline is, from a staffing strategy perspective.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Eric Severson: How do you know whether or not the teams that you've built are adequate for the opportunity that CSU is facing?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Tom Malek: Oh, we can't do that, Eric. Oh, no, we can't do that. Like, it's all, like, we all have it, it's like, oh, you just, it's all apples and oranges. You can't, like, measure any of that. You think we can trust any of our systems? No. We do it based on how we've always done it, and look at how successful we've been.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Eric Severson: This gets…

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Tom Malek: Sorry.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Eric Severson: I got it. And so, at least I want to bring a visibility to that.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Eric Severson: Uh, effort. So, the other thing is, is, is the same adoption tracking stuff, where they're building… I sat with, with Ernie, who I like.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Eric Severson: quite a bit. He is a little tedious, but a smart, you know, head and heart are aligned, and he's a worker.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Tom Malek: Mm-hmm.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Eric Severson: And he's going through finishing off their itineraries for the year. And when I asked him about it.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Eric Severson: How do you do that? There's… it's all one-on-one with the manager and the individual.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Eric Severson: And it's pretty much what we did last year, right?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and so, okay, there's also, I guarantee there are ways to look at.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Eric Severson: individual performance in this whole thing. So what we don't have.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Eric Severson: in this data, and what I'm aware of, but it's too much work for me to take on right now.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Eric Severson: Is calculating conversion.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Eric Severson: by cohort. So, we have overall conversion assumptions.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Eric Severson: But at UTI, we would do both generalized functions, meaning.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Eric Severson: Let's do all conversion and fire, all conversion and safety. Versus, let's look very specifically at this lead converted to this application, to this enrollment.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Eric Severson: by this person. Then you can see, do you have differences in conversion.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Eric Severson: by outreach Rep. So, yep, they're not actually enrolling, but they are… there is a level of preparation and follow-up to that handoff.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Eric Severson: That I think probably varies across the team and, you know, and again.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Eric Severson: I don't know that we can get to this until Jason has really.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Eric Severson: Unfuck the plumbing, right? Because… yeah, but there is way… there are definitely ways.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Tom Malek: Oh, yeah.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Tom Malek: Wow.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Eric Severson: to evaluate rep performance and outreach. It's certainly more than just raw numbers.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Eric Severson: But it is raw numbers. How many did you go to? How many leads did you create? And then… and then how many of those turned into enrollments is a reasonable.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Tom Malek: Oh, yeah. Yep.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Eric Severson: Thing to look for.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Eric Severson: We can't do that today.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Tom Malek: No.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Eric Severson: Of the things, if you think about…

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Tom Malek: Yeah, thanks for showing that to me, that's pretty cool. I'm glad it all exists.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I'll send it to you. And again, my biggest bugaboo is…

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Tom Malek: All I've ever seen is a report that shows…

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Eric Severson: Can we…

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Tom Malek: by account.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Tom Malek: Um…

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Tom Malek: Leads, applications, and uh… enrollments.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Tom Malek: And I've always used those. Like, one of the scariest numbers that I saw.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Eric Severson: Across multiple years?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Tom Malek: Uh-huh.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Eric Severson: Across multiple years?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Tom Malek: Yes.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Eric Severson: I don't think I've ever seen that.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Tom Malek: Ed… Ed Weathington had to send me the data. He had to, like, pull the… pull the together and send it to me in a file.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Tom Malek: But that now goes back 3 or 4 years. But then, even when I took that, I've sent that to you, like, years ago.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Eric Severson: You…

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I have it, and I can get it.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Tom Malek: Yeah, you don't have to go… it's nothing to look at, it's just… it's just what we're talking about. Like, it's the kind of report you would have for, you know, the… your monthly update as a sales manager at…

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Tom Malek: You know, Pearson Industries.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Eric Severson: In 1992.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Tom Malek: Well, certainly by 97, Matt changed the world, dude.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Eric Severson: It made it a little better. So, again, I'm gonna finish this off and give it to her, let her dig into.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Eric Severson: you know, I'm happy to help you with this stuff. Uh, for you, I would be happier if you went about expanding your…

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Eric Severson: footprint in the AI range outside of Caroline. This stuff…

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Tom Malek: Yep.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Eric Severson: I think is a comment about…

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Eric Severson: You know, there are two… you should have management visibility, and you don't, really, right?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Tom Malek: No, right.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Eric Severson: And all the time you put metrics together, it's a single point in time.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Eric Severson: So, these are things that will help you. We really need to look at the degree of.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Eric Severson: degree enrollment or application in FIR and OSH versus education and nursing.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Eric Severson: If you're trading.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Eric Severson: Uh…

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Eric Severson: bachelor's for master's, that's a net revenue gain. If you're trading master's for bachelor's, that's not a net revenue gain.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Eric Severson: That's super easy, since we have a one-size-fits-all pricing model. By the way, that's probably another thing to pick up with Ken at some point, to go, hey.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Tom Malek: Right.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Eric Severson: You ever think about pricing relative to the salaries that people get? Does it make any sense to you that you.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Eric Severson: Charge the same amount to generate a social worker as you do a cybercrime specialist.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Eric Severson: Right? When you know that social worker's gonna make jack and that cybercrime specialist is gonna make a bunch of money.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Eric Severson: Um…

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Eric Severson: It's easier to calculate, you know, how things are going, but if you're ever really in a squeeze for profitability.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Tom Malek: I don't think I ever realized that. They charge the same for every degree?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Eric Severson: Yep. Yep.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Eric Severson: If you look at our… it's a… it's a credit hour, uh, cost.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Eric Severson: I don't know how many universities differentiate. I know UTI sure the does.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Eric Severson: Uh, yeah, I don't know how many universities differentiate. If you're an undergrad, you're probably playing the same for computer science, engineering, or social work.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Tom Malek: Oh, yeah.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Eric Severson: Is that right? No, that seems a little fucked, to me, at least.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Eric Severson: And so, I wouldn't lower the social work, I would raise the tuition.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Eric Severson: I would look at the tuition as it applies, as it aligns to expected earnings, right?

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Eric Severson: At least think about it, uh, as a way to adjust things.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Eric Severson: Um, because we definitely did that at UTI big time. Uh, and I know, because I was constantly working on.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Eric Severson: The incentive metrics and the legal people hated anything that looked like a percentage of tuition.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Eric Severson: They hated it. They felt like it exposed us legally to all sorts of problems.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Eric Severson: Which is why, you know, I spent so much time rolling around in that.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Eric Severson: And there may be a good answer for it, it's probably some big-ass thing about.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Eric Severson: affordability. Um, and I, you know, again, I wouldn't…

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Eric Severson: Push too hard, but…

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Eric Severson: You know, the cost of materials seem like an easy area for you to bring in a hard ass if you really need to look for margin, uh, distance quickly.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Eric Severson: I would say beat the out of the publishers to see what can happen there. And the other place would be, you know, look carefully at differentiated pricing.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Eric Severson: Those are two things you could do.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Tom Malek: And then how much did, uh… it was $15 million in publishing?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Eric Severson: Relatively.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Eric Severson: 15 to 18. Somewhere in between 15 and 18.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Eric Severson: Again, it's not in the nature of the place, but if you… if Ken needed.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Eric Severson: To look at margin improvement rapidly, the two things that I can think of that you could do.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Eric Severson: Without tremendous amounts of internal turmoil is, again, beat the living out of the publishers.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Eric Severson: And, uh… and then look at differentiated pricing.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Eric Severson: of the two, differentiated pricing would be even easier. You just put it in place.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Tom Malek: I mean, I like throwing low numbers out there, so, like, what I would tell Ken on $15 million, just 5% is $750,000.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Tom Malek: So, like, you know, 10% is a million and a half. That might be a tough nut if you've already… if you're using eBooks that are already super cheap.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Eric Severson: How do we know they are super cheap? Who do you suppose negotiated super cheap? Wendy?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Tom Malek: In which… in which… in which way?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Tom Malek: Yeah, I mean, that's a good point.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Tom Malek: But… I mean, e-books are sold on the open market for, like.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Tom Malek: $39.99 for a semester's youth, and if you're ringing the bell on that every 6 weeks using the same book.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Tom Malek: You know, for like 10 different terms, like, I mean, who's looking at those details just to make sure that you're not doing that?

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Eric Severson: Nobody, right?

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Eric Severson: It's a big number.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Tom Malek: I mean, but it's possible that, hey, we're going to give you a book on the individual and not on the, like, student ID number. I don't know, there's lots of ways to kind of look at.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Tom Malek: Yeah, so yeah, you're right, if he wants to save $1,000,000, I mean, that's less than 10% of what you're spending.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Tom Malek: That seems like a pretty easy ask.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Tom Malek: Now, the challenge is gonna go back… the challenge would go back to Janelle, like, hey, sorry, Janelle, but…

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Eric Severson: Yep, differentiated pricing.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Tom Malek: You know, these 40 classes… these 40 courses that you've selected materials on in your business program, they all have to change to Cengage.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Tom Malek: You can no longer use Pearson, so, like, go to… but they're so frickin' interchangeable, that shouldn't be hard.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Eric Severson: Well, there's… there's probably…

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Eric Severson: There's probably some… I mean, again, I… of the many documents that I wrote, one of them.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Eric Severson: That you have is all about complete independence on materials.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Eric Severson: Right? And so there could be a route that just looks at.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Eric Severson: where is there an area that you could start to either use OER, or…

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Eric Severson: if… again, back to the AI thought.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Eric Severson: What does the AI progress suggest for.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Eric Severson: Institutions, and their relationship with publishers and content.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Eric Severson: Right? And what are those… what are the opportunities in there? You could start off at a very basic level. When was the last time you brought in all your publishers and put their knuckles in a vice?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Eric Severson: and said, honestly, and just cranked the bejesus out of it, nobody here does that. They take the price as the price, right? I used to have.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Tom Malek: No.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Eric Severson: At Pearson, I used to have conversations about negotiating with the hotels because things were getting too expensive, and.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Eric Severson: That the woman that did all of the event planning negotiated, never.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Eric Severson: Well, that's the price. I'm like, did you ask? Well, no, that's the price. They gave me the price for Priceless.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Tom Malek: You said you wanted to go here.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. I was like, because it's not her budget, and not her money, and she didn't really care. And so…

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Tom Malek: Right.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Eric Severson: It's the same premise here of saying, alright, put the publishers under duress.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Eric Severson: And let's see what happens. You'll probably get something out of that. And then, who is thinking about, actively, the instructional materials model.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Eric Severson: in the New World. Uh, and again, we know at least one major online publisher in.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Eric Severson: University of Phoenix went from being Pearson's number one customer to nothing.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Eric Severson: And University of Phoenix didn't do anything but gain benefit out of that. So we should look at that model and say.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Eric Severson: What can we learn from that about course materials and an online institution?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Eric Severson: And, you know, what do you want to… how do you want to handle that?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Eric Severson: Is anybody talking about that, for sake, right?

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Tom Malek: Probably not. I'll… I mean…

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Tom Malek: I kind of want to ask, but I kind of don't want to do that work. Oh, hey, meet Tom, former publishing guy who's going to squeeze the out of your knuckles, right? You know, it's like, oh, meet Pat Sullivan.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Tom Malek: I hated that guy. I don't want to hate… I don't want people…

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Tom Malek: But, if we could, like, be in the background and help Wendy, fine.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I mean, I don't really care anymore about that. I have no desire to work for a publisher again, so it'd be…

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Tom Malek: No.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Tom Malek: No, right, that's what I'm… okay, so you're saying that…

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. I mean, it would be… I would… I would feel bad for Allie's out of it. I would feel bad for Beth Munoz, maybe, but I don't know how bad I would feel about that.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Tom Malek: It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Tom Malek: I don't even know if it's her. I mean, it would be Scott Schaefer. He would have, like, skin in the game with McGraw-Hill, but, you know, likelihood, he probably has the least amount of market share, and it might be a way that he could.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Tom Malek: Expand his, you know, somebody's gonna win.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Tom Malek: But we need to review all the to be able to see what you could do. Alright, I might ask if I can review the file. Hey, look, I mean, I would assume working with Wendy, who enables and supports his whiskey buying, be a lot more fun than working with Caroline, who's been beating on me lately.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Eric Severson: I bet you we're paying rack rate?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Eric Severson: Maybe.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Eric Severson: Baby!

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Tom Malek: Alright.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Tom Malek: Well…

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Eric Severson: So, I'll… I'll send you this. Don't do…

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Tom Malek: Do you miss the winter wonderland?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Eric Severson: Oh, yeah, no, I'll… I want nothing to do with that.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Tom Malek: It's not too bad.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Eric Severson: No, thank you.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
Tom Malek: Yeah.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Eric Severson: Sunny and 70 here today.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Tom Malek: That's awesome.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. What else? What else should we chat about? Anything?

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Tom Malek: Alright.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Tom Malek: No, thanks for talking to me, it was good, yeah.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I…

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Tom Malek: I'll, uh, I'll follow up with Ken this week and keep things moving.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I'm excited for you to pull me along with that, and then just, you know, in the interest of.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Eric Severson: of smooth water. Keep.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Eric Severson: Caroline involved.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Eric Severson: Uh, with this whole thing, so…

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Tom Malek: Yeah, I'll forward anything I write to Ken, I'll forward it to her.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Tom Malek: No problem.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Eric Severson: What else? Anything else?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Tom Malek: I don't think so, should there be?

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Eric Severson: I don't think so.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Tom Malek: Okay.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Eric Severson: See ya.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Tom Malek: Bye.
