00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Eric Severson: Duane, how are you feeling?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Duane Brown: I feel like I got run over by a truck.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Eric Severson: Oh no, I'm sorry. Yeah, I mean…

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Duane Brown: That's okay.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Eric Severson: I hope it wasn't us, we… we were very clearly not feeling perfect when we were there, right?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Duane Brown: No, no, it was probably my son, you know, it's been going around to school, and…

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Eric Severson: Totally.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, it's… it's, uh, he's sick, and so…

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Duane Brown: Yeah. It's a nasty one. I've never felt like this before.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Eric Severson: Well, I'm sorry.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Eric Severson: And is it flu, do you think? What, what is…

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Duane Brown: So… yeah, it is the flu? Yeah, I mean, even, like, my teeth hurt. I mean, it's everything. It's crazy.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Eric Severson: I had the flu maybe 10 years ago, around the holidays, and both my wife and I got it, and it was maybe 20 years ago, because we had small children at the time.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Eric Severson: You know, and small children are, you can't just say, I don't feel well. I mean, they were that small, totally dependent on a small, like.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Eric Severson: 5 and under, 2 under 5.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Eric Severson: And it… that year, actually, that was the year that the anthrax stuff was being mailed around.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Duane Brown: Oh, wow.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Eric Severson: And I was so sick, I thought, maybe we got anthrax somewhere, dear.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Eric Severson: Uh, but boy, I… that…

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Eric Severson: That flu, it can… it can be very bad, no question about it.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Duane Brown: I didn't realize you had enemies like that.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Eric Severson: Well, it's funny, at the trade school.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Duane Brown: Hey, Tony.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Eric Severson: They, uh…

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Eric Severson: I came in after about 2 or 3 months on the job.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Eric Severson: And there, it was really sort of ugly. We were having to go through some pretty hard performance management things, and uh…

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Eric Severson: I was so popular at that point as the new SVP that I got in the mail.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Eric Severson: in Arizona, over the weekend, uh…

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Eric Severson: elephant or cow So, there's something called poop senders.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Eric Severson: Where, if you're really unhappy, you can go, and it's totally anonymous. I was pissed, because the bottom dollar is cow They'll send.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Eric Severson: uh, cow all the way up to, like, gorilla And I don't know if it smells bad, worse, or what it is, but…

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Eric Severson: whoever was unhappy with me, and it just comes in, like, a FedEx envelope, and it's an envelope of and so…

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Duane Brown: Wow.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was… that's the trade… that's the…

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Duane Brown: Hey, what… Tony, watch your mailbox.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, now, you'll know where it came from. It's not really that hard to put together, would it be?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Duane Brown: I'm kidding.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Duane Brown: I can't… yeah, well, you know what?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Duane Brown: You can't… you can't keep everybody happy, you know?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Eric Severson: Okay, there's two things that I wanted to talk about quickly. One is the Orlando City Partners List.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Duane Brown: So…

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Eric Severson: Um, which I sent you both, and I'm just gonna pop this open, and we'll take a look at it, talk through it for a second.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Duane Brown: Hey, Tony.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Eric Severson: Uh…

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Duane Brown: Who, who, who's yours?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Tony Atchley: Hey, yeah, um, who, who, who, who's yours gonna, who's gonna be your daddy next year?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Tony Atchley: Did you see who we landed?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Eric Severson: No, where did he live?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah, so we got, uh, we got probably the best, uh, receiver, or quarterback receiver.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Duane Brown: No, I missed it.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Tony Atchley: uh, combo that you could have gotten through the portal this year through Duke.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, yeah, Minsa is gonna be… he's… he's gonna be the next, um…

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Duane Brown: Oh, really?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Duane Brown: Oh, yeah.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Tony Atchley: kind of QB phenom, and got his number one guy from Duke, so…

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, we'll see about that.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Duane Brown: We'll see about that.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. Yep.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Eric Severson: I'm a little back and forth about the portal. Is it an absolute disaster, or is it good and entertaining at this point? And so…

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Eric Severson: You know, it's interesting to see.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Duane Brown: It's ruined… it's ruined the sport. I'm just being honest. There's no… there's no…

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Tony Atchley: It has.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Eric Severson: Well, that's what I'm…

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Duane Brown: There's no loyalty, you know? I mean…

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's changed it, for sure, instead of the…

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Duane Brown: It's like, boo hoo, I didn't start the first two games, so I'm gonna go somewhere else now. It's just ridiculous.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Eric Severson: It is definitely different, definitely.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Duane Brown: I don't mind them making money, which they should, but I've told Tony, I mean, it should be put in a trust fund. They shouldn't get it until they graduate from college.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Eric Severson: That's a great idea.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Duane Brown: I mean, so then they're… they've had that. I mean, what if they get hurt, and they've spent it all their freshman or sophomore year?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Duane Brown: You know, I mean, it's…

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Duane Brown: I mean, you got guys driving around campuses with six-figure cars. I mean, it's ridiculous.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Duane Brown: Absolutely ridiculous.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Eric Severson: If they're… they're too young to… to understand the importance of how to manage their money, there's no question about that, but it…

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Duane Brown: Yeah.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Eric Severson: It does make for…

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Eric Severson: A new and interesting dynamic, uh, and from a spectator perspective, that's all I'm saying.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. Well, if you… and if you're… if you're not there, uh, you're… you know, you're… you're gonna…

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Eric Severson: Okay, so…

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Tony Atchley: fall so far behind, you know, that as a program. And, you know, look at Clemson. Uh, Dabo clearly, you know, he didn't adopt it.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Tony Atchley: And look where he is in a matter of, you know, 4 or 5 years. You know, his program is…

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Tony Atchley: Not… not keeping…

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Eric Severson: Pace, with expectations, yeah.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Tony Atchley: You know, not keeping pace. Indiana is a perfect example of, you know, they never would have been where they are this year.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Eric Severson: Nope.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, had they… yeah, had it not been for it, so…

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Eric Severson: I mean, the bummer part about it, it's not exactly a Cinderella story because of all of that, but it's still very exciting to see the overall team dynamics, uh, in terms of.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, okay.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Eric Severson: Spectating where go. Okay.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Duane Brown: Well, plus with… plus with Indiana, I'm sorry, plus with Indiana, I mean, you have a whole… a whole bunch of misfits.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Eric Severson: Yes, sir.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Duane Brown: That weren't 5 stars, that, you know, a whole bunch of them, a whole bunch of them turned into 4 to 5 stars.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Eric Severson: I… that's a cool story. I like that story.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Tony Atchley: They do.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, never underestimate the chip. The chip on the shoulder go a long way for, uh, for, uh, performance, so…

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Duane Brown: You know? Yeah.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Tony Atchley: Yep.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Duane Brown: Yes.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Duane Brown: Okay, I'm done.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Eric Severson: You know, have you guys… have you guys seen the, um, the Lakers documentary on Netflix?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Eric Severson: Winning time, I think is what it's called. We…

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Duane Brown: I haven't watched it.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, fantastic, great story. We do a ton of sports documentaries around here. It's my way of getting my wife excited about various different sports.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Eric Severson: Works, because then we can sit down and watch. So, the coach of the… at IU looks exactly like the, the, uh…

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Duane Brown: Nice.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Eric Severson: the guy that they cast as one of the early coaches of the Lakers, when you see that.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Duane Brown: Oh, wow.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Eric Severson: blows me away. Okay, so this first task is, uh… Duane, I'm gonna ask you to help me out with this a little bit. So, one of the… what is in this spreadsheet.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Tony Atchley: Hmm.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Duane Brown: I'll have to watch it.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Eric Severson: is the partners for Orlando Pride, which is the…

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Eric Severson: ladies soccer team in Orlando City. Why this is relevant is we're spending…

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Eric Severson: I think 200 grand a year, so 600 grand over 3 years for a partnership with the Orlando City soccer team. And by we, Dale has done this, and so there are a bunch of different opportunities.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Eric Severson: primarily around direct lead gen, but one of the things that they have is.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Eric Severson: They have a partner summit.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Eric Severson: where it's a networking event for all of their partners. Now, it doesn't guarantee that they all come, or who comes from these events, so Tony and I have had one experience with these sort of networking events, but.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Eric Severson: Um, if you look at their website and the partner page on their website, Orlando Health is the biggest contributor and partner for the Orlando.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Eric Severson: city soccer team for both the soccer… city club and for Pride. At one point, I thought, and I even said to, um, Caroline, if this is all about healthcare and then.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Eric Severson: the…

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Eric Severson: premise that we're… so Dale's been pitching this as a B2B benefit, a big B2B investment.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Eric Severson: And I've been gently trying to qualify that as, well, maybe, maybe.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Eric Severson: Right? And so, initially, we did a bunch of looking at…

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Eric Severson: How close are companies on the Space Coast and in the aerospace industry, and can we get them to attend these things?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Eric Severson: Versus, there's a pretty good…

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Eric Severson: opportunity to get first responders into some of the events that the Orlando City Soccer Club has.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Eric Severson: They have a Battle of the badges, Fire Against Police, and so all of this stuff. And I've been having this ongoing dialogue with Caroline about.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Eric Severson: What is our role versus what is Sherry and Outreach's role? And my…

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Eric Severson: Basic premise has been to push back on, this is a business development investment.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Eric Severson: And say, not really, this is really a direct lead gen investment.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Eric Severson: Because you're gonna see signage around the stadium, there are going to be outreach reps that go and do things. We have the Battle of the Badges, which is fire and police, that we can go ahead and support.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Eric Severson: But, in reality, do I think that Eric and Tony are gonna be… and Jim are going to be able to drive attendance from aerospace?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Eric Severson: I don't think so. And I went, and I looked at all of our…

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Eric Severson: I don't have a great degree of confidence that that's going to be something that we're able to do. I looked at all of our partnerships, put them in mileage buckets from the stadium. Most of them are outside of 60 to 90 miles away.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Eric Severson: Most of them we don't have any relationship with, so it'd be like Eric and Tony trying to find somebody, invite them to a game. I can tell you, I live in Phoenix, we have major MLS, we have major sports here.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Eric Severson: Other than a Cardinals game, and even if I had a free ticket to the Cardinals game, I'm not sure I'd go. It's an hour from where I live, it's a fucking hassle to get there. I've been to enough baseball games here to not care anymore, right? It's just a hassle.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Eric Severson: to get there. And so, extending that same notion of women's soccer, who's gonna drive more than 15 minutes to go see a women's soccer game?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Eric Severson: or even the, you know, the Orlando City Club. And so, I'm pushing back on this as a B2B.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Eric Severson: Uh, initiative, and saying, this is really pure lead gen, it makes way more sense for you guys to focus.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Eric Severson: on education, because that's everywhere. School districts are everywhere, so if you're going to try to drive attendance.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Eric Severson: Education and municipalities would make way more sense to me than aerospace or anything that we were trying to focus on.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Eric Severson: So that's just a bunch of talking to say, yes, this is… if you hear it as a business development thing, I'm pushing back on that a little bit, trying to give this to Sherry. But…

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Eric Severson: One of the things that I did look at is they have a partner summit at the end of every year where.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Eric Severson: All of their partners are invited to the game the night before, match the night before, and then there's a morning agenda the next day.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and it's a basic networking event. And, you know, I wanted to look at who are their partners.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Eric Severson: Where, you know, do they fall from industry and a number of employees? And I definitely think it will either be me and Dale, it may be me and Tony, maybe Caroline, but somebody from.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Eric Severson: our business development needs to go, not just Sherry, and shake the hands of these people. There's a fair… there's only one healthcare, really, and the rest of it is.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Eric Severson: what I would put in that, just big industry category. Automotive is in there quite a bit. Uh, there's some, you know, retail stuff, as you would expect, food manufacturing, that sort of thing.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Eric Severson: So, on this…

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Eric Severson: It is just a spreadsheet where I wanted to pull the information together to be able to look at it and say, alright, this is what we've got. And so.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Eric Severson: I pulled it all together, pulled in the industry, and then I went, and I looked at a live… our live alumni.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Eric Severson: Accounts to say, of these companies, where do we have evidence of students.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Eric Severson: in live alumni. Interestingly, we don't have learning partnerships with some of these companies. Not shocking, their numbers are pretty small.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Eric Severson: Uh, I could find very few actual numbers in, um, in…

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Eric Severson: Power BI, but I was filtering… our Power BI only includes learning partners.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Eric Severson: And so, what Caroline immediately said is, you have to go to Omega, we have to go to Omega for everything.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Eric Severson: And so, Duane can… and I have not figured out how to do this, but to go into Omega, search for.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Eric Severson: these company names, and to see, basically, you know, have we ever had students that are enrolled from these companies?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Eric Severson: And what would we do with that? I mean, uh, we'll definitely… some of these are clearly going through.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Eric Severson: learning, uh, benefit company, Scholarship America for both GEICO and Ford. If I'm able to meet somebody from GEICO and Ford there, I definitely want to do that in the same way that we want to.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Eric Severson: tell the story and get a little bit beyond, uh, beyond the benefit company. So this is the story of custom curriculum, a la Signal Mutual or LVT. This is, you know, the story of solving problems.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Eric Severson: Other than your traditional degree seeking, but also, you know, making the point about our affordability compared to everybody else.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Eric Severson: And I'm… so, for the ones that have learning partnerships that are benefit companies, it's the same. Down here for Orlando Health, or Pepsi.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Eric Severson: It's interesting that, you know, the biggest ones are sitting under Scholarship America.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Eric Severson: Then we have Publix, Raising Cane's, Verizon, who I didn't even know… I mean, that's clearly old, CSEG is clearly old, so…

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Eric Severson: So there's a compelling reason to do this. What I'm asking for your help with is to look them up in Omega.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Eric Severson: regardless of whether or not they're listed as a learning partnership, and I'm not really sure how to do that, and then to see, you know, what is our historic number of students?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Eric Severson: So I'll pause there and see if there are any questions. Duane, do you know how… do you know how to do that?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Duane Brown: So, historic, how far do you want to go back?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Eric Severson: 5 years is totally fine, right? Yeah. And if that's a nightmare, 3 years is completely fine.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Duane Brown: 5 years.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Duane Brown: Okay. Um…

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Duane Brown: I'm pretty sure there's a report that you can… that's… I'll pull… I'll pull… I'll go in there and look, and once I find it, I'll copy you on it, I'll send it to you as well, the name of it.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Duane Brown: So you can… you can go in and pull it as well, so…

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Eric Severson: Great. Yeah. Great, great, great.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Duane Brown: Yep, I can't… off the top of my head, I don't know the name of the actual report, but I know one exists of…

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Duane Brown: Um…

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Duane Brown: Like, prospects and students without, like, a learning partner.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, I think it's… it's…

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Eric Severson: Looking… can we search by…

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Eric Severson: It's not even Learning Partners, just an employer. Is there a way to search? Yeah. Okay.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, yeah, there… yep, yep, yeah, yep, there is. I just have to… I'll find it, and I'll… I'll pull it, and I'll copy you on it.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Eric Severson: Okay, great.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Eric Severson: Um, and then, Tony, I… I went through here and said, alright, because of size, or maybe scope, or…

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Eric Severson: Prior existence of students.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Eric Severson: Here, these X's are where I think the key targets might be. And again, this is…

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Eric Severson: a partner summit where they may or may not even attend, and who knows who from the organizations are going to be there. So…

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Eric Severson: I don't… I think it would be silly just to ask Sherry to do it.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Eric Severson: But I don't want to tie a tremendous amount of optimism.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Eric Severson: about upside to these. I think there's maybe only one morning event, right? And so…

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Eric Severson: If we get anything out of it, it would surprise me. But there's enough here to say, hey, look.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Eric Severson: For the benefit company ones, we're always looking for ways to build a relationship with someone at the actual company.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Eric Severson: For some of these that are not benefit companies, you know, I would start with, hey, did you know, GEICO, that we have.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Eric Severson: 67, uh, we can find in our alumni database, 67 people that have self-identified as GEICO employees that are also CSU alum.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Eric Severson: Right? That's pretty cool. Uh, we would love to make sure that we're talking to you about.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Eric Severson: that, about what we can offer, right? Just to make them aware and say, hey, did you know we might be a little bigger than you otherwise thought?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Eric Severson: Um…

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Eric Severson: Any other…

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Tony Atchley: So there… so… so an observation on some of these companies.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Tony Atchley: Um, and just, I think a question worth asking.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Tony Atchley: Is, um, some of your, like, um.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Tony Atchley: Heineken, PepsiCo, um, Raising Cane's.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, I would imagine that some of that is gonna be, or a good part of that is gonna be at the local level.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Tony Atchley: So it's gonna be sponsorships that are a result of their beverage contract.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Tony Atchley: um, their snack contract, you know, those sort of things. Even the Ford Motor Company, uh, I'd be curious to know, is that.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, a local, uh, dealership or dealership group.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Tony Atchley: you know, or is that Ford, you know, is that big Ford? Uh, and, you know, there may be some relationships at this level that tie in with national-type contracts. If so.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Tony Atchley: That's great, and then you gotta figure out who the representative is there, and then, you know, not that any of this can't lead you back to the mothership.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Tony Atchley: You know, ultimately, but, uh, some of those, I think, are gonna be those kind of partners.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Tony Atchley: Um, yeah, yeah.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Eric Severson: I 100% agree. 100% agree. And so the… again, I'm not trying to be Dolly Downer on this whole thing, but…

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Eric Severson: I… these are the partners and the logos that they put on there, but I've worked with Ford at UTI, I'm almost certain.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Eric Severson: That that is a local dealer network, right? Some guy that owns probably 10 dealers.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Eric Severson: in northern Florida, and 2 or 3 of them happen to be in Orlando, right? So, in that scenario, it's a meet and greet where you sort out.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Tony Atchley: Yep.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Tony Atchley: Right.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Eric Severson: how many employees do you have? If it's a, you know, a high net worth individual that… which is almost always what the automotive dealers are.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Eric Severson: then they're not gonna give a It's a 5-minute conversation and you move on. If that, it may be a 5-second conversation and you move on.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Tony Atchley: Yep.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Eric Severson: So, uh, and I would imagine the same thing on Powerade, Pepsi, you're exactly right, it's probably local.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Eric Severson: distributors that are paying for that, and I'm not even sure… I might ask.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Eric Severson: ask a question about getting to the home office, but I'm not even sure I would spend that much time, because again, I lived in the middle of.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Eric Severson: the Ford National Company and the local dealerships, and it's a difficult relationship, right? The corporate entity.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Eric Severson: Uh, thinks that the local guys are… are…

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Eric Severson: you know, not very informed and argumentative and difficult to deal with. The local guys are high network individuals that will step on a nickel for anything, right? And so there's this.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Eric Severson: constant tension. We had… we had quarterly events in New Jersey, where we would bring in, uh, the local dealers, and they were close enough, so they'd come in as a national group, too.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Eric Severson: It was wild to watch, because we would always do it in a restaurant. The dealership over on this side of the room, the national guys over on this side of the room, and we're right in the middle. But it happened every single time. I'm like.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Eric Severson: Do you guys know each other? Do you not want to know each other? Do you not like each other? And…

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Eric Severson: The answer is no. And so that means, look, I would not spend a lot of time trying to navigate from the local Heineken distributor to Heineken headquarters. It's just not gonna happen.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Tony Atchley: Yep. Yep.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Eric Severson: And so, in that case, you eat your little pigs in the blankets, you have your stale beer, and you go, yeah, cool soccer, and you go home, right?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Duane Brown: We used to have Ford… Ford used to be a learning partner, like the corporate company, the main company.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Eric Severson: So…

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Duane Brown: A long time ago.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, yeah, and I'm, you know.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Eric Severson: There's… there's still…

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Eric Severson: I mean, I think they're still… so the alumni database is interesting. Caroline definitely gave me the… that thing's not accurate, which is, you know, everybody around here, this is the one…

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Eric Severson: refrain at CSU is that's not accurate. And so the… that's unbelievable. And so the…

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Eric Severson: you know…

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Duane Brown: How many times have we said that, Tony?

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Tony Atchley: Cool!

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, well, okay. So, in this… in this… the Ford Motor Company.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Eric Severson: Has, according to the alumni database, which is probably underreported, because it's self-reported.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Eric Severson: So who's going out and falsifying, you know, degree information on LinkedIn? A few people, not most. If anything, people might not be putting in.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Eric Severson: that they're a current student at CSU as a Ford Motor. 24 people identify right now as being.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Eric Severson: a Ford Motor Company employee that is also a CSU alum.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Eric Severson: Right? And so, we're still getting them, would be my guess, and they're coming through Scholarship America, so…

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Eric Severson: Okay, so that was the first part of this, and all I really want you to do is, uh, plug in on this.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Eric Severson: Targets tab.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Eric Severson: if you find it, you know, what's the… I don't suppose we have an omega ID, so probably just use the name of the partner.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Eric Severson: And then, if you can put in here, yeah, the number of students, uh, as another, just to due diligence. And what is this useful for?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Eric Severson: So, I will take this as a crib sheet, and make sure that everybody that goes to that partner event.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Eric Severson: Right? It might be Dale and Caroline have that, or it could be…

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Eric Severson: you know, else. And again, to work it in with…

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Eric Severson: with, uh, PepsiCo. And again, the guy might not give a if the PepsiCo distributor is the local Orlando.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Eric Severson: you know, beverage world guy, he may not care less that Pepsi, as a broader corporate entity, can… has had 112 people.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Eric Severson: And so, it may be kind of a moot talking point.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Eric Severson: But, that's the first thing. Okay.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Eric Severson: Uh, the second thing I wanted to step through is…

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Eric Severson: Uh, two things. So, we… did we go over the copy compliance?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Eric Severson: thing… did we ever talk about that?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Duane Brown: The… the landing page stuff?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Eric Severson: No?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Tony Atchley: The landing page…

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Eric Severson: No, there's something new, so let me go through that.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Eric Severson: Um…

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Eric Severson: Here's… a couple of them.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Eric Severson: You should be able to get to this, and I'll send you a link here in just a second.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Eric Severson: This is on ChatGPT, and I think you should be able to get to this.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Eric Severson: Directly, you have to tell me, so I'm putting it in the chat message right now.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Eric Severson: Um…

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Eric Severson: And then let's get to the one on our…

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Eric Severson: Cool pilot.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Eric Severson: Oh, and let me share the screen so you guys can see what's going on here.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Duane Brown: Oh, well, Lich. Has the leak been fixed, Tony?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah, um, I've still got to replace a tile. Interestingly enough, they narrowed it down for the, um…

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Eric Severson: the link.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Duane Brown: Awesome.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Tony Atchley: sound, um…

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Tony Atchley: capabilities that they had to one 12x12 tile in my, um, in the… literally in the center of my house, but in the patio area.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, you told me that.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Duane Brown: Mm.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Tony Atchley: And so he, uh, took sledgehammer… or not Sledgehammer, but the jackhammer.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Tony Atchley: And, you know, busted through the concrete and found it. Ended up being about a dime size.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Tony Atchley: Um, copper pipe that, over time had, um…

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, you know, kept flaking off, and it just ended up, you know, hitting a.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Tony Atchley: Hitting a point where, you know, it's saturated and started coming up.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Duane Brown: Yeah.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Duane Brown: Well, thank goodness, thank goodness it was a pool area, not your bedroom.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Eric Severson: Um…

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Eric Severson: CSU Greenlight, or over here, it's the green light copy checker.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Eric Severson: What this is, is a agent, or a custom GPT.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Eric Severson: That has all of the regulatory and compliance standards that sits in its knowledge base.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Eric Severson: And has guidance for…

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Eric Severson: looking through the copy, and we would want to start to use this before you submit anything to marketing, right? In that marketing form.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Eric Severson: Because…

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Eric Severson: Uh, it will go through, and it will give you a readout as to where, if any, risk shows up.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Eric Severson: And we'll talk to Jim about this as well. It should make it easier to get copy marketing requests.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Eric Severson: processed in a timely fashion. And let me show you how this thing works, and I'll… we'll talk about this other piece in just a second.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Eric Severson: So, here, I'm working on, uh…

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Eric Severson: Helping get custom content for our maritime.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Eric Severson: Landing pages, which is also what we'll show you.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Eric Severson: And here is…

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Eric Severson: 100 word…

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Eric Severson: Option. So, when you take the.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Eric Severson: Proposed copy that we're going to submit at some point, and we're not going to submit this, but before you do it.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Eric Severson: You just simply plug it in to either the GPT.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Eric Severson: If you can get to it, uh, and…

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Eric Severson: What a custom GPT does is it will go through, and it will use the underlying data sources, and I spent a…

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Eric Severson: Little while doing research on all of the underlying data sources that are relevant.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Eric Severson: for compliance for a for-profit university. So there's FTC.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Eric Severson: stuff. There's Consumer Fraud Bureau, the CCFB is in there. There, of course, is our accreditors.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Eric Severson: Uh, guidelines around marketing and admissions, and when you plug it in.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Eric Severson: what you get, and I'm gonna amend this a little bit. I just got these things up and running, and again, this is what marketing does.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Eric Severson: Marketing will go through, and they have to present… they will give it their judgment about what's an effective marketing promotion, but then they will also.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Eric Severson: Go through and figure out what are all of the compliance and regulatory conditions that we need to meet before they go through an approval process with.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Eric Severson: uh, Sonya Kopp or her person, Jennifer Lee Harper, right? And I'm trying to help all of them.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Eric Severson: leverage AI. At UTI, this was an enormous headache, right? We would have.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Eric Severson: eager and excited people like us, putting all sorts of aspirational copy requests through, and it would get… it would go… it would take weeks for the marketers to weigh in, the compliance people to weigh in.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Eric Severson: It's going back and forth between marketing and compliance, and it's enough to just make you scream. And so, for me.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Eric Severson: AI is fantastic when there is a regularly published body of authoritative work.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Eric Severson: And so when you think about regulatory bodies, they publish everything, and they are authoritative.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Eric Severson: So, the biggest thing, and it's probably a little bit too much detail that we want to look for is.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Eric Severson: Where are we doing interpretations? And by we, I only care about this if it bogs down. If the marketers and the compliance people can't get their.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Eric Severson: done in a timely fashion, uh, then, you know, then it's… help me understand why. And this…

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Eric Severson: These 2 things do the same thing, so they're exactly the same.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Eric Severson: Uh, it is intended to help educate us a little bit, and to make it easier to submit the copy.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Eric Severson: So, I wrote this from Navy shipyards, commercial terminals, maritime employers struggle to find safety professionals.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Eric Severson: With industry-specific knowledge, traditional programs don't address Jones Act compliance, ship construction hazards, or maritime cargo operations, leaving a critical workforce gap. Obviously, I don't know that that's coming out of AI as well.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Eric Severson: CSU's Maritime safety concentration fills this void with four targeted courses developed alongside Signal Mutual members.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Eric Severson: who identified exactly what employers need. Graduates understand regulatory frameworks, risk management strategies, operational realities unique to maritime environments as the industry invests in new facilities.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Eric Severson: and equipment, trained safety personnel become essential. Prepare for high-demand roles where your specialized expertise makes an immediate impact.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Eric Severson: Part of what we're trying to do is to give Richard and Signal Mutual some copy to work with.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Eric Severson: And then part of what we're trying to do is to reflect that, the similar sentiments on our webpage.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Eric Severson: So, that seemed pretty clean, pretty good to me, right? You run it through.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Eric Severson: And what you get is first report. Below is a marketing compliance review that provided copy, you get a high-level summary, it's well-positioned, largely compliant, but it contains.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Eric Severson: Implicit employment and demand claims and partnership language that creates moderate regulatory risk if published without clarification or substantiation.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Eric Severson: Overall tone aligns, so I also have the CSU brand standards, which came off of our website, and we have something called CSU Acceptable Terms.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Eric Severson: It's all in here for this. So it just goes through, and the first thing it does is.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Eric Severson: And I think this is worth us…

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Eric Severson: You know, as we request more and more things, and Jim in particular, I think this is worth.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Eric Severson: Trying to be educated about…

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Eric Severson: what are the constraints or the influences on the copy that we submit? Now, Tony, for Signal Mutual.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Eric Severson: We might be in a slightly different position, and we need to ask for clarification about.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Eric Severson: copy that Signal creates, even if we suggest it. If Signal creates it, I don't know what our…

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Eric Severson: regulatory and compliance requirements are, but I definitely know if we're going to put it on our website, like in a landing page, that we need to be looking carefully at.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Eric Severson: Where does this stuff hit? So it goes through the risk areas, and it describes them, and then it gives you suggested compliant rewarding.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Eric Severson: and specifically preserving the marketing intent, or the promotion intent, and it just gives you a revised lower risk. You read through that, you decide whether or not you can live with that.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Eric Severson: And then, you know, my suggestion is that's what you…

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Eric Severson: submit. There's no reason to get tangled up in this whole thing. Then what I'm gonna suggest is that we print this out, either copy and paste the whole report, or, you know, I think you can just print it to…

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Eric Severson: share it. I think there's a way to share it as a PDF.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Eric Severson: I'll have to double check on how to get this thing out. I would just cut, copy, and paste it.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Eric Severson: Is it here? Yeah, I would just copy and paste it into a Word document, and then submit it with the copy to demonstrate that we've done something to evaluate the quality of the copy.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Eric Severson: So that, you know, the Britneys of the world, Fillmore can move more quickly through this and go, yeah, they can scan it and go, hey.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Eric Severson: This… there's been a little bit of effort to make sure that we've got compliant copy going forward.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Eric Severson: Uh, you can do the same thing here, uh, if you want. I haven't actually…

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Eric Severson: uh, spent much time with this. I happen to like the output in ChatGPT. It's exactly the same structures.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Eric Severson: Uh, the only difference is the two models. You guys know I don't think very much of the Microsoft models.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Eric Severson: But, in this case, it looks to me like it's pretty close…

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Eric Severson: Uh…

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Eric Severson: And it gives you a compliant revised copy. So it doesn't really matter, in fact, if you.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Eric Severson: look at them both, and I think one's slightly better, probably better to use the one on the Microsoft thing.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Eric Severson: And all you have to do to get to that is it should be in here. So, can you do me a favor and verify? Can you go into your co-pilot, Duane, and see if that… and Tony, and see if you can see the…

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Eric Severson: the green light copy checker. And the way to go to Copilot is literally just take that.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Eric Severson: this, right here.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Eric Severson: Which I will stick in the comments.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Eric Severson: Or in chat, rather.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Eric Severson: And see if you can't log in and find that thing.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Duane Brown: Okay…

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Tony Atchley: And this is going to be under All Agents.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Eric Severson: Should be under all agents, yeah.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Eric Severson: Or you might click in the search and see if it just drops down, or… or search on green light.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Eric Severson: Either of those will work.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Duane Brown: Mortgage…

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Tony Atchley: Green light doesn't come up with anything.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, we couldn't find any results for green light.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Eric Severson: Let me see…

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Tony Atchley: Uh-huh.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Duane Brown: And this is part of, like, Microsoft Copilot?

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Eric Severson: Uh, yes, this is Microsoft Copilot, so make sure you're logged in at CSU, because if you have a.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Eric Severson: Personal Microsoft subscription, you can… you might be in under your own personal one.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Duane Brown: Alright, let me check.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Eric Severson: And then here's the direct link to it in the chat.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Eric Severson: But again, you gotta… you gotta be…

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, I'm signed in under Columbia Southern.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah, I did too.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Eric Severson: Okay, good, yeah.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Eric Severson: try the link, see if the link will… will work. I know, um… I know…

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Eric Severson: Dale… uh… well, actually, I don't. I know Dale used one of them, but it's why I put the ChatGPT out there as well, it's just…

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Eric Severson: sometimes easier.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Tony Atchley: Alright, so when that came up, it has a…

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Tony Atchley: add button.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Tony Atchley: to it.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Tony Atchley: At the top, do we need to click on the add to have it add to the agents?

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Eric Severson: Beats me, yeah, you do that, see what happens.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Duane Brown: Did you type in the, uh, the link, Tony?

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, I clicked on the link, the second link that Eric just provided.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Duane Brown: Oh, duh.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Tony Atchley: And it brought up the green light copy checker.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Eric Severson: Cool.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, so now let me go over to…

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Tony Atchley: the agents…

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Tony Atchley: See if it's gonna show up under there.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Duane Brown: What was the link again, Eric?

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Eric Severson: It's in that… it should be in the chat.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Eric Severson: If you open up the chat, it should be sitting right in there, that second one.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Tony Atchley: Okay, so now I'm sitting at…

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Tony Atchley: On the co-pilot page with the green light copy checker.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Eric Severson: Cool. Now, I just put a copy chunk for a different narrative in there, in the chat. Copy that out.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Duane Brown: I got you.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Eric Severson: Copy that out and plug it into…

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Eric Severson: Uh, plug it in there.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Eric Severson: And I would bookmark the co-pilot agent thing, just.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Eric Severson: Um, for two reasons. A, I want us to use this.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Eric Severson: because I think it will help…

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Eric Severson: I've had two meetings now with, uh, Sonia and Jennifer and the marketers.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Eric Severson: You know, and this is in the category of change management and, you know, you've got.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Eric Severson: A level of anxiety about AI that's off the charts with these folks.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Eric Severson: Some of it is, you know, I don't know, I'm having a hard time finding a smooth working relationship with marketing in general.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Eric Severson: So, some of…

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Duane Brown: Okay, I have it, I have it now.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Eric Severson: Okay, good. So cut, copy and paste that second copy chunk.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Eric Severson: In there, and I just want to make sure that it works.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Duane Brown: Alright.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Tony Atchley: Alright, mine came back with… it looks like it wasn't able to access the CSU compliance documents you uploaded.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Tony Atchley: I don't know what I did. All I did was…

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Eric Severson: Put it in there, and then click the up arrow.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Eric Severson: Can you, um, take a screenshot of that and send it to me? Because I've got to get these guys going on this.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Eric Severson: Or, let's try this one also. I'll send you this link for…

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Duane Brown: Looks like the compliance documents you uploaded came through as empty or unreadable.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Duane Brown: So I wasn't able to access the rules. I need to evaluate your marketing copy before…

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Eric Severson: Yes.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, if you can see that screenshot, I don't know why that would be. It's… but I do, I guess, if I don't have… this is back to…

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Duane Brown: I can provide.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Eric Severson: the permissions issues, I may not have the ability to… to…

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Eric Severson: publish, you know, everything at CSU is locked down to a point where.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Duane Brown: Oh, yeah.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Eric Severson: It's ridiculous, right?

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Eric Severson: Ridiculous.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Duane Brown: Hm.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Eric Severson: Um, which is why I put it in ChatGPT. So, try the same thing in the ChatGPT link.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Eric Severson: And see if you can't get to that.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Eric Severson: And definitely either copy and paste, or do a screenshot of that error message and send it to me, because I'm gonna ask the AI… the IT guys.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Eric Severson: What's up with this? Here's… how do we… how do we find a, you know…

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Eric Severson: Path here.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Tony Atchley: I just sent that over to your…

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Eric Severson: Thank you.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Eric Severson: Then can you get to it on…

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Eric Severson: The ChatGPT link.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Eric Severson: Which, again, is in the chat.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Tony Atchley: Okay, so when I did that…

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Tony Atchley: It came back with the marketing compliance review, and it's…

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Eric Severson: Good. Terrific.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Tony Atchley: It's spitting it out now.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Eric Severson: Terrific.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Eric Severson: Terrific. So, until we get to…

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Eric Severson: Until I can UN-fuck this IT situation.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Duane Brown: Fuck!

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Eric Severson: This is… which may… which may be the second of never.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Eric Severson: we'll use the ChatGPT version. And again, as we get closer to submitting copy.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Eric Severson: I want to use the…

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Eric Severson: Report as evidence that we've run it through just to see, you know, does this, it should improve.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Eric Severson: the processing time. Now, I'll tell you both marketing.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Eric Severson: Brittany actually said, this'll take… this is gonna waste a whole lot of time, and I thought, really? How could it possibly waste time, right?

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Eric Severson: You're running this through, and so if you want to see what's in these things, how they work.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Eric Severson: a…

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Eric Severson: They work in the same exact way, both in ChatGPT or in Copilot.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Eric Severson: So, you have instructions, which are the prompt, and it's really pretty simple. You're a marketing compliance evaluator for Columbia Southern University.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Eric Severson: Your role is to help marketing teams create effective promotional content while ensuring regulatory compliance. How you work.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Eric Severson: Read the user's marketing copy carefully, check it against the CSU compliance rules in the uploaded documents.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Eric Severson: So it just goes through all of that. Critical guardrails, right? Never replace human legal review, all that stuff. And then, so that's the prompt, really pretty simple in terms of.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Eric Severson: When you see a complicated prompt, it could be 15 pages, right? So, prompts can get super.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Eric Severson: complicated. This is definitely not a complicated prompt.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and then what you have here is just… these are just text files, basically, that will show, uh, privacy and data rules, CSU compliance framework, higher ed-specific rules.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Eric Severson: CSU internal standards, FTC… FTC marketing rules.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Eric Severson: And the red flags checklist, and what these things look like. They're just text files that go through.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Eric Severson: And, you know, make…

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Eric Severson: make the… I don't know that I can show this quickly or easily, but go through, and there's nothing magic about this, and the reason I want you to see it is that.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Eric Severson: Increasingly, AI is English language. It's all it is. And so, let me figure out how to share that.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Eric Severson: Text file…

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Eric Severson: There's nothing mysterious or magic or deeply technical about it.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Eric Severson: So this is the red flags checklist. MD is Markdown. Markdown is just a text format.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Eric Severson: that large language models or AI is able to rip through very quickly. If you put a Word document in there.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Eric Severson: Word documents have all this formatting bullshit that's all over it that you don't see, but that a large language model has got to process and get rid of.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Eric Severson: This, when you start working really closely with large language models, very easy to format stuff as markdown files. And you go through here, and look, man, this is just the English language.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Eric Severson: So, for why I keep going back to the AI stuff.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Eric Severson: it empowers… well, you need to know a few of the tools, and understand. It's not like you have to be a programmer. There's no programming here.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Eric Severson: It's well-structured and well-organized information that's plopped together in these tools that enable.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Eric Severson: these different outcomes to come in place. So, you know, these are really just looking for flags, speed and time claims. Any of these words are going to get flagged, right? Because they are going to set off regulatory risk factors.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Eric Severson: Employment, career promises, you can't say, land your dream job. You can't say, high demand for it. All this frustrating.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Eric Severson: That you want to say that is true, but because of the sins of the past, of the motherfuckers and for-profit education we're all living, still.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Eric Severson: With this, you know, the overhang of regulatory and compliance assumption that for-profit equals, you know, criminal or bad.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Eric Severson: So, it's not anything, you know, anything that anybody can't do. And did I write this from scratch? Of course not. I did it all using AI and said.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Eric Severson: You know, did I read through it? Yeah, and I went through it and said, you know, let's cut it down, let's get to the most, most, uh…

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Eric Severson: The essence of what we really need to. So, uh, again, the same 6.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Eric Severson: work, uh, documents or text documents loaded up into both. I appreciate the… the image send. I want to get that in front of IT.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Eric Severson: and see if, you know, I can't get, uh, get us to a point where… where we're…

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Eric Severson: able to share the stuff on our core infrastructure. Why is this good?

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Duane Brown: I got it to work… I got it to work on ChatGPT.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Eric Severson: You did good, good, good.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and then I would just try one more time on the Microsoft thing. Sometimes…

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Eric Severson: you know, got a little glitchy, who knows, just take that same copy and paste it back into the Microsoft thing and let it go. I think Dale was able to use the this part.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Eric Severson: And again, if you catch from other parts of the organization that this is going on, we're not trying to replace anybody, right? AI as a replacement for people is a bad idea.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Eric Severson: AI as an augmentation to speed things up is a great idea. Where AI is the most suited is where there are things that are well-documented and published by an authoritative source, right?

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Eric Severson: And so, uh, this is a perfect use case for it. It should make Brittany Fillmore's life a lot easier. She can just focus on marketing judgment, uh, and not have to worry so much about the compliance issue.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Eric Severson: It should make Jennifer Lee Harper and Cobb happy at a certain point.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Eric Severson: Because they have both an educational tool and, you know, there's an audit trail that this thing can… can…

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Eric Severson: Trigger that is supportive of, you know, if you ever do get challenged by.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Eric Severson: you know, some sort of compliance group, so…

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Any other thoughts or questions? Did it work the second time in Microsoft Pilot?

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Duane Brown: Didn't…

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Eric Severson: Nope, same. Same bad message. Okay. Alright.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Duane Brown: Nope. Yep.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, I'm sorry, the files that should contain CSU compliance rules appear to be empty.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Eric Severson: They're not empty. I did it on mine one more time.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Eric Severson: Oops, that's not what I want.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Eric Severson: I want… copy.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, I got the same thing.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Eric Severson: Okay, it's super good to know, that's our friends in IT, which should be happening…

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Duane Brown: And it should automatically work, right? I mean, there's nothing in settings that you have to switch or anything?

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Eric Severson: All you do is…

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Eric Severson: No, uh-uh.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Duane Brown: Okay. Okay.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Eric Severson: Not that I'm aware of, I mean, uh, have you used any of the other agents in here ever?

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Duane Brown: Mm-mm.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Eric Severson: The writing coach is pretty good, not bad. Yeah, so this is… again, this is how it should work.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and this second one has a bunch more concerned identified.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Eric Severson: So… Okay, um…

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Eric Severson: The other thing that I wanted to…

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Eric Severson: show and see if you want to try Duane.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Eric Severson: is, uh, and, and again, I think this is a good idea.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Eric Severson: So, I'm gonna send you the link to…

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Eric Severson: the Google AI Studio, and the first thing will be, can you get to it?

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Eric Severson: So, it goes into chat.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Eric Severson: They're building, by the way, a page builder for us, but it's gonna be quite a while, right?

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Eric Severson: So, uh, I sent them the progress, and I started bogging down on it, going, hey, look, this is not trivial, this is going to take a long time.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Eric Severson: So, in the chat is the Google AI Studio. When you click on it, what happens?

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Duane Brown: I've got a sign in.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Duane Brown: It's asking me to sign in.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Eric Severson: Do you have a Google account? A personal account?

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Duane Brown: I do… I do, yeah.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Eric Severson: I think it's free, I don't think you have to pay for this.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Eric Severson: So the… the AI Studio…

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Eric Severson: Is a developer tool, and it is a tad less friendly than the other tool, but it's also where they put.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Eric Severson: Their state-of-the-art stuff, right?

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Eric Severson: And so, the first thing…

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Eric Severson: Well, I'll wait. Let me know if you can get into it.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, I've got to go through the security… everything. Yep.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Eric Severson: Bullshit. Yes, this is the thing that pushes me to the edge of my patience 9 times out of 10, is.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Eric Severson: All the security hoo-ha.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Eric Severson: What about you, Tony? Are you able to get to the Google AI Studio?

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, so I'm at the start building with Gemini screen.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Eric Severson: Does it look like what I got on screen there?

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, yeah, yeah, it does.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Eric Severson: Okay, good.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Duane Brown: Why is yours, like, black? Mine, um… I mean…

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Eric Severson: So, I… that's just a system setting called dark mode.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Duane Brown: That's right. Okay.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Eric Severson: And that's your Windows… window systems. Okay, good. I do that because it's hard on my eyes. I got these goofy-ass looking glasses in order to try to cut out the blue light, because I spend a lot of time staring at computer screens. Okay.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, I got it. I'm at it right now.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000
Eric Severson: So the first thing we're gonna do is change the model right up here from Gemini 3 Flash.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Eric Severson: to, uh, Gemini Pro Preview. This is their strongest model. So all you have to do is click that, and it should say Gemini 3 Pro Preview.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Duane Brown: Gemini…

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Duane Brown: 3 Pro, click that. Okay.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Eric Severson: Yep. Okay.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Eric Severson: So first, I'm going to show you quickly what we're trying to do, Duane, and this is really for you to start to get a… I think this will be a faster way for us to.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Eric Severson: fiddle with the way that pages look. Now, if… if it turns out that we… that we can get through this, you know, again, why am I keep going back to this? Because Sherry scared the crap out of me with 6 weeks to get the.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Eric Severson: ANA web landing page built. That's crazy business, right?

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Eric Severson: So, here, uh, what I did in the…

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Eric Severson: This you will have to look at, uh, a bunch of…

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Eric Severson: Okay, how do I get the dot? A bunch of code, but you don't have to create it, I promise.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Duane Brown: No, I did a couple samples in ChatGPT.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Eric Severson: Okay. So this, I think, is…

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Eric Severson: The… again, it's free, it's the Learning Studio thing.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Eric Severson: Uh, here's our Signal Mutual landing page. I took the URL out of that and started.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Eric Severson: Uh, with…

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Eric Severson: Please clone this page, right?

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Eric Severson: And it'll suck it in, it'll clone it. When you're looking at it, and you're… this is HTML code.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Eric Severson: You have a preview button. When you click the preview button.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Eric Severson: It's gonna show you a preview.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Eric Severson: Right? That's ass ugly, so it didn't work.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Eric Severson: So, I went down through here.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Eric Severson: Uh…

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Eric Severson: Oh yes, this did work, by the way, so we just got to get to the right place.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Eric Severson: Uh…

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Eric Severson: Features the clone, all this stuff, I didn't really care about all this stuff.

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Eric Severson: But what I then did was said, I want to build a page or app that lists the original page and shows 5 revised versions.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Eric Severson: of the same page for reference and comparison. I was in a hurry, because this is a poorly written statement, right?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Eric Severson: usually what I would do is put this in ChatGPT or in Gemini, put my ugly-ass statement there, and say, please clean this up for a prompt, right? So, trying to use this as a prompt in AI Studio, or.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Eric Severson: some other model, please help me clean this up. But it worked anyway. Add the following copy to each page revision. Stay within the main branding and color palette, simply add in the new copy and any related images that fit the theme of the revised copy.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Eric Severson: And then, I plugged in, you know.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Eric Severson: I had ABCD and E versions of copy that we're gonna send to Richard, that we're trying to figure out what would make the most sense for Signal Mutual's customized landing page with us, and for them.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Eric Severson: To do as an advertisement or a promotion out to their, to their members.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Eric Severson: And this is just, uh, you know, copy. It's… it's the copy before I plugged it into the…

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Eric Severson: uh, copy compliance checker, so, you know, but I just wanted to see, will this work?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Eric Severson: Okay, so here's version A, we'll just keep going through this stuff. Uh, and when I click on preview…

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Eric Severson: I click on Preview, and show preview. Starting to look a little better, right? And what you can see here… I don't know how to make this bigger yet.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Eric Severson: But here's the original clone, there's some broken in there, and here's what I was after.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Eric Severson: I have course focused.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Eric Severson: Okay, interesting. I have… and these are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 different copy types.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Eric Severson: Uh, this one is, uh, condensed market focused career path.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Eric Severson: talent gap. So, we continue to go down through here. I gave it this image.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Eric Severson: which is the full, uh, page of the Signal Mutual page, that's what it looks like top to bottom.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Eric Severson: Honestly, some of this is horrendous, like…

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Eric Severson: All of this, it's just too much.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Eric Severson: stuff that says nothing, right? And there's zero comment in here about our courses. I mean, we… this is why we need to revise these things, but I put it in there.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Eric Severson: And said, clone the page, blah blah blah blah blah, from this, this again.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Eric Severson: And it said, I think I may have put, make it pixel perfect. And it said, I've used exact layout, hex color, all that crap.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Eric Severson: I don't think this is super necessary, but I wanted… this took me about 10 minutes.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Eric Severson: In total. Uh, and then, you know, it kept going down through here with a few more prompts.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Eric Severson: Uh, please review the attached image, blah blah blah, make it as closely as possible.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Eric Severson: And when we get to the bottom here.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Eric Severson: we've got something that is serviceable. Now, is it perfect? No, it is not perfect, but it looks a of a lot more like our original page.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Eric Severson: And then, here's version A.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Eric Severson: Here's version B, version C, version D, version E. Now, if you copy or download this, it's a single piece of HTML, so you can put it into a folder on your directory.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Eric Severson: double-click it, and it will come up as a full page. And so let's do that now. We'll go ahead and download this.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Eric Severson: We'll save it in a directory, and we'll put it in files. I got Signal Mutual in here somewhere, Signal Mutual…

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Eric Severson: I'll put a new directory in here, just called.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Eric Severson: junk.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Eric Severson: And I'm copying AI Studio Code, we'd probably name it something different.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Eric Severson: Now we're gonna open that up, and I'll…

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Eric Severson: double-click it. I know you guys can't see this, but that's what's happening.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Eric Severson: Oops, I gotta go.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Eric Severson: Do I have to go right now?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Eric Severson: No, I do not. If you've got a couple more minutes, we'll just finish this up. Now, Duane if you…

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Eric Severson: Start trying to do this, and it's, uh… it's not working.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Eric Severson: You can either… I don't know how necessary this is going to be. The point of this is to do a little brainstorming to try to accelerate the process.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Eric Severson: Of getting the stuff through…

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Eric Severson: uh, marketing. If it's not necessary, I'm not requiring it.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and it's not important to do. There's two… let me get to… where did I put that? I put that in Signal Mutual.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Duane Brown: Under junk.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Eric Severson: under junk, and let's open that up. Good. So, here it is.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Eric Severson: broken link, I don't really care. It's close enough, right? That's our original page, basically, not perfectly.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Eric Severson: Here's version A, okay? Now, we wouldn't probably put that in there, but it gives you a chance to.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Eric Severson: look and think about it, and figure out, here's version B, right? That looks…

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Eric Severson: A little better in there.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Eric Severson: Version C, version D, version E.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Eric Severson: The point of this is two things. One, to make sure that we're continuing to show you guys.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Eric Severson: the tool sets that AI enables make it possible for regular guys.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Eric Severson: To do technical stuff, right? The reason I'm starting to push on.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Eric Severson: Frankly, Ken, to raise expectations across the organization, this is the moment.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Eric Severson: You're either keeping pace, or you're falling behind on your skills. I think that marketing should have 3x expectation with 0 ads to staff.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Eric Severson: If they're not learning AI, they should be, and it's because this kind of stuff.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Eric Severson: Changes the speed and the volume of work people are capable of doing.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Eric Severson: And so, it's important to me that I show you guys this. I have no special magic, right? I'm not a programmer. I'm a freakin' English major who takes the time to try stuff.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Eric Severson: And is not hemmed in by retarded constraints from IT. I do it all on my own personal computer, which is.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Eric Severson: Wide open. But, the point of this is to speed up the process. So, Duane, if this.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Eric Severson: isn't speeding up the process. You should call me and we could step through why or why not. And ultimately, if it's unnecessary or it's.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Eric Severson: you know, it's not value add, I don't want you to do it. I just want to make sure that, hey.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Eric Severson: I want… again, all of this is off of the 6 weeks to get to an ugly-ass American Nursing Association landing page.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Eric Severson: That, in my view, should have taken maybe 6 hours max to do.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Eric Severson: How do we fix that process so that we're not caught grinding in a ridiculous.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Eric Severson: constraint-based, bureaucratic And it's two things. It's, let's supply copy and documentation that it's ready, that it's… we've done a due diligence that hasn't been done previously.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Eric Severson: should make Brittany's workload less, and then stuff like this. If giving them a visual.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Eric Severson: is going to speed things up, then let's do it. If it's not, because either it's taken us too long to figure it out, or.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Eric Severson: they don't care, then okay, then we won't do it, right? But…

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Eric Severson: That's the reason…

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Duane Brown: So what… so I do have a question. So, from the marketing side, you know, it took Sherry 6 weeks, you said?

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Eric Severson: Yes.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Duane Brown: Okay, so why did it take 6 weeks?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Eric Severson: So, I don't know how much time you've spent with Sherry in getting…

01:07:53.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Duane Brown: Is it because they have so much on their plates, or was it because they had… they had to create all this new stuff.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Eric Severson: Uh…

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Duane Brown: For what she was asking for.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Eric Severson: I don't believe there's much new stuff in here.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Eric Severson: Here's the… here's the ANA page. So, an image, that shouldn't take that long.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Duane Brown: Hello?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Eric Severson: This, that shouldn't take that long. This, that shouldn't take that long.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Duane Brown: Right.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Eric Severson: Copy, okay. This is all common sense stuff, right? That shouldn't taken that long.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Eric Severson: A video, okay, I doubt they had to go out and make the video, they repurposed it, it's.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Duane Brown: It's on YouTube, yep.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Eric Severson: stuck in here. This, uh, why choose Columbia Southern? This. So…

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Eric Severson: this. This might have taken a little bit of time. If they had to go and refresh it.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Eric Severson: this grid may have taken time. But, I'm guessing…

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Eric Severson: You know, information based on tuition and fees updated as of December 18th.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Eric Severson: So maybe that's what took time. They had to sit down and had to validate, are these things correct?

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Eric Severson: Or not. And then you get all the disclosures sitting here at the bottom, right? Uh…

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Duane Brown: Right. Yeah.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Eric Severson: I mean, when I look at this, I'm like, okay, this is good, and it actually moves past.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Eric Severson: percentages to real dollar comparisons. Honestly, a little risky for a for-profit organization to do this kind of thing. So, yay for…

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Eric Severson: Either the risk tolerance or the ignorance, but it shouldn't have taken 6 weeks to get this part done.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and if you ever are really curious about stuff, by the way, the ChatGPT one, I think we can just do…

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Eric Severson: Copy that, go back over to ChatGPT, go back over to the green light.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Eric Severson: And it's…

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Eric Severson: I mean, if you want to say, please analyze…

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Eric Severson: this page, you can, but I'm not even sure that's necessary.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Eric Severson: Leave it in there. I don't know whether or not this one will do it…

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Eric Severson: So, you can… I mean, I don't know why we would bother with this, but you can run it on existing pages.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Eric Severson: Uh, I know that there were, you know, some compliance risks in here.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Eric Severson: But, you know, there's your summary of compliance risks.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Eric Severson: I think this is great, and I would hesitate from… if you do do this, just keep it to yourself, because.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Duane Brown: Right.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Eric Severson: I've been in a place where compliance went crazy, and it's such a pain in the neck.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Eric Severson: I don't think, A, Sonya, if she saw any of this, would probably be angry, but I don't think Sonya cares.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Eric Severson: And Jennifer Lee Harper is new enough in her role, and honestly, I don't think the marketers.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Eric Severson: are getting into the super detailed weeds about compliance and regulatory issues, which is great. That's freeing for us. I was at a place where they had zero risk tolerance, and it was a nightmare to get anything.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Eric Severson: done. So, you know, yes, we can plug in existing landing pages, don't do it.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Eric Severson: Unless you really have a desire to stick your head in that meat grinder. For new stuff, though, where we're requesting it.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Eric Severson: as a way to show marketing that we're doing some due diligence around this. Only if it speeds things up. If, for some reason, it slows things down, we'll abandon all this. I don't… I'm not precious about any of it.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Duane Brown: Right.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Eric Severson: I just want to do, with you guys, two goals. One.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Eric Severson: What are things that we can do to optimize internally, potentially? Two, continue to show and encourage AI usage on stuff, because.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Eric Severson: I think we're in a point where the world is going to start moving much quicker now, and you're either going to be on top of it, or you're going to get further and further behind.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Eric Severson: Uh, especially for jobs where they spend all their day sitting in front of a computer.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Eric Severson: If your job is to go press the flesh, field-based, and you're out with people, you're gonna be fine.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Eric Severson: But everything else is going to come under, you know, two directions. They're going to need fewer people to do the same amount of work, or they're going to raise the expectations about the amount of work that the current.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Eric Severson: people can do. Uh, and I really just want you to make sure that we are staying on top of that, and we see it, uh, and understand it.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Eric Severson: So…

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Duane Brown: So, my next question. So, you've had this conversation with Brittany in marketing, to let her, or Dale, to let him know that we're gonna be working on this stuff?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Eric Severson: Dale liked it. Dale likes it. Uh, Dale, uh, they have their own internal project team that is…

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Duane Brown: Okay. Okay.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Eric Severson: been thinking about it for 3 months. Thinking about it for 3 months. They came up with a catchy title for it called RoboCop.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Duane Brown: Got it.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Eric Severson: But there is nothing today. And so, you know, my offer to them is, I'm not trying to build stuff around here to be the builder. I'm much…

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Duane Brown: Huh.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Duane Brown: Right.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Eric Severson: interested in being the enabler. So if you have a project team, I mean, what really needs to go on here is a compliance person needs to vet those 6 files and say.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Duane Brown: Right.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Eric Severson: Yes, these are the 6 files. I used AI's deep research, and then I looked at it, and I know from the last place.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Eric Severson: what most of them are, but am IA qualified compliance evaluator? No. So, you know, but…

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Duane Brown: Right.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Eric Severson: They all, I mean Sonia.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Eric Severson: Is… was less interested…

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Eric Severson: Dale was excited, because he dropped a bunch of copy that he knew was way out of line in it, and it gave him back a very good feedback.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Eric Severson: Brittany, for some reason, thought it would just bog things down. Now, I'm having.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Eric Severson: mixed interactions with Brittany at this point, and so I'm quietly thinking to myself.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Duane Brown: Got it.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Eric Severson: get out of the way, right? You should be down the road of figuring this stuff out a lot better than I hear. I hear resistance from her on a fairly regular basis, and so…

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Eric Severson: I think that is the kind of role that is going to get left behind with prejudice, brutally, in the next.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Eric Severson: 9, 6 to 9 months, simply because my perspective would be, you should be able to do triple the output.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Eric Severson: with skills. If you don't have skills, it's on you. CSU's not doing for building skills. No, most employers are not.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Eric Severson: But, pretty soon, you're just gonna feel yourself falling behind. So, you know, figure that out.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Duane Brown: No, I like it, so…

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Tony Atchley: So, when you say…

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Tony Atchley: When you say Brittany, are you saying, uh, Fillmore or Armstead?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Eric Severson: Well, Fillmore way worse than Armstad, but I get the same on Armstad, saying, okay, it's the C as you know, right? Everything starts with 55 reasons that it can't happen.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Tony Atchley: Sure.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Duane Brown: Like, with the ad code? The code inside the ad code for our department? Yeah.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Eric Severson: And I…

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Eric Severson: all of the bullshit. It's now… now, I expect to get nothing but pushback and excuses out of them.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Eric Severson: And I quietly think, what I'm saying, Dale, is let me come in here and help teach your people, because again, there are two departments at CSU.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Eric Severson: that I'm gonna say this to Ken at some point, I'd triple the productivity expectations with zero additional headcount. IT and marketing.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Eric Severson: And if they're not, then you're falling behind, dude. The tools are there. There's not magic involved in it. It's not coding, there's no technical hurdle.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Eric Severson: It's time to learn this stuff, which is accessible to everybody. If you're… if you're resistant because you don't like change.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Eric Severson: Okay, I mean, those are other… those are other conversations with this stuff.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Eric Severson: So, yes, I'm having less trouble with Armistead, but still, every conversation starts out with.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Duane Brown: Right.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Eric Severson: She told me that we could get to new landing pages the end of, uh, 6 months from now. And I'm like, you know what? We're just gonna start to shove things into that marketing form.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Eric Severson: Uh, because I also see them doing work, so it's, it's very much.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Eric Severson: That, if you're willing to take their nose and sit quietly with your hands in their lap, you'll get nothing, and you'll like it.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Eric Severson: But in the meantime, they're doing work for academics, they're doing work for.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Eric Severson: Dale's Pet Projects, because we got the Orlando Soccer Club that needs a landing page. They're doing work for Sherry when she yells at them for 6 weeks in a row.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Eric Severson: And so, they're doing work, they just don't have a good prioritization model, and uh, you know, the stiff arm.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Eric Severson: Is what they're doing. So rather than scream, I would rather say, let me do some work to make this easier for you guys on the…

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Duane Brown: Got it, yeah.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Eric Severson: Right, so… I don't know that they're perceiving it that way yet, so…

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Duane Brown: Bye.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Tony Atchley: So, let me… let me ask this. When, uh… when do we want to come together, or when are we gonna… when are we gonna look at the enhancement aspects of.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Tony Atchley: What we're gonna do with the landing pages.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Eric Severson: Well, we need to get Richard 100 words, right? So the first thing is, I've got 4 of these.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Eric Severson: descriptions. I'm gonna run them through the copier, copy compliance checker, revise them, and then send them to you, and then you and I have to have a conversation about… I mean, we don't have to have it in person, you can just write me back and say.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Tony Atchley: Mm-hmm.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Eric Severson: I like this one. I need some clarification internally from us about…

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Eric Severson: Uh, so… Richard does this externally, without, you know.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Eric Severson: a web page. Who do…

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Eric Severson: do we get involved in that or not? Because we… Richard might be able to say stuff that we technically can't put on a website, but he can put it in an outbound email all day long. And Duane, this is relevant.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Eric Severson: topic for us to understand from regulatory and compliance issue, because the same thing would be for benefit companies, right?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Eric Severson: what a benefit company might be able to say may be different than what we can say, but I don't know that for sure.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Eric Severson: And so, you know, I… I hate asking.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Eric Severson: For permission from compliance, because they're hard-coded to know, right?

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Eric Severson: It's safer if you don't. And that's never the question I'm asking. I'm asking.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Duane Brown: Hmm.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Eric Severson: what's the risk, right? I'm not asking you for permission, yes or no. You're here to advise us on the level of risk.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Eric Severson: I would like your advisement on the level of risk. So we gotta get that, you know, in the past, would you just give it to Richard and not bother with running it through the marketing request?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Tony Atchley: Mmm…

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Tony Atchley: No, no, I mean, you know, most stuff that has been provided to date would either be.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Tony Atchley: You know, approved boilerplate, or, um, you know, something that, like, you know, the landing page.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Tony Atchley: Um… has been given to them as far as, you know, specifications, but it is, you know.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Tony Atchley: It's cookie cutter, so all that's been…

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Tony Atchley: You know, approved by marketing already, so…

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Eric Severson: I mean, I have the data, I think I may have sent you the data, and we're now… the data exists that goes for customer journey, and what…

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Eric Severson: What we saw with Perkspot is…

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Eric Severson: It's, you know…

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Eric Severson: so teeny, it's almost not relevant. And that's not a huge surprise, right? I think this is a conversation for us to pick up in this next quarter, is.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Eric Severson: let's get these landing pages so that they're focused on conversion. I think these are built for the economy of Brittany and Brittany, not for the conversion of people that were driving there.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Eric Severson: So, they're getting there almost by accident. Let's, you know, we need to figure out a couple of things. How do we drive more.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Eric Severson: direction here, and that's through the benefit companies, or through a sponsor like Richard.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Eric Severson: Then once we get them here, we gotta start working on conversion metrics, not just.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Eric Severson: traffic. So today, there's minimal, infinitesimal traffic, frankly.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Eric Severson: But at least now we can see that, and we can start to look at that, and start to improve on that.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Tony Atchley: Yep.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Duane Brown: Hey, Tony, I have a good way for us to track our traffic from the benefit companies.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Duane Brown: So I'll just create a QR code in JotForm, and just copy and paste it onto the landing page.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Eric Severson: Oh, that'll be popular.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Duane Brown: And then they can just… they can… they can just scan that, and then every… everybody that scans on it and puts their information, an email comes to me.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Eric Severson: I believe there was just a blow-up about some dude in the military division that did exactly that, and I got a stern note from Caroline. Did you see that?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Duane Brown: Uh-uh.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, so I thought you were kidding around. Don't do that, please. I'll forge you the stern note from Caroline.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Eric Severson: It addresses exactly that.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Eric Severson: But she knows that I'm, you know.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Eric Severson: Quasi annoyed with all things.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Duane Brown: So, hey, so does that mean if we're… if I'm doing an event, and I'm at my table, that I can't use JotForm anymore to collect the leads?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Eric Severson: Uh, I will send you the exact wording, and you've got to decide what it is. But, by the way, while I have you guys, we have to start to fill out the Salesforce thing with full details, right? So it's gotta look just like everybody after action report.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Eric Severson: She's been, uh, on me about that for… since I got here, and so I've…

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Eric Severson: stiff-armed it until 26, but now, as you come back from that thing, we gotta make… you know, they're desperate for calculating the leads, and I understand that.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Eric Severson: So, we just need to… when you're filling it out next, don't use the placeholders, whatever the…

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Eric Severson: Learning partner activity visit is, make it look like everybody else is in there.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Eric Severson: We don't have the same volume standards or expectations, of course, but uh… but we'll do that.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Eric Severson: Okay. So, this is a fast flyby, this is not what I would call training. Uh, most important thing for you guys is.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Eric Severson: If all of this stuff does not work to the objective, the objective is to make it faster.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Eric Severson: for us to communicate what do we want to do with marketing and compliance, then do not… I am not precious about any of this. If it doesn't serve the objective.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Eric Severson: Just let me know, and we might… we might have a short conversation about is… why is that?

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Eric Severson: And, uh, and we'll go from there, right?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Duane Brown: Well, I mean, we won't know until we actually put one together and send it to marketing and see what happens.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. Yeah.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Duane Brown: So, yeah, yeah. Okay. No, I'm all for it. I mean, I think it's… it's great. I mean, that way we can, you know, customize it.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Duane Brown: You know, whenever we need to, and send it to them, and they just change the copy, or whatever we're wanting to replace.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Eric Severson: So, the other thing that's probably worth, uh, at least a quick flyby for you guys, so when I am working in.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Eric Severson: with AI for content creation.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Eric Severson: I will take a bunch of documents, and you can do this in ChatGPT, you can do it here in Copilot.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Eric Severson: I tend to use Claude for writing a lot, and the… the concept is a project.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Eric Severson: So, look at all these projects that I have, and what a project includes.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Eric Severson: is custom instructions and a file library. So, for the…

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Eric Severson: CLO, this thing Tony and I went to.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Eric Severson: These are all what are called knowledge base files. So for our weekly updates, I take all of our weekly updates from you two and Jim, and I stick them into.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Eric Severson: of one of these projects. And then I ask it to go through.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Eric Severson: Dedupe, consolidate, and identify the main themes that come out of this.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Eric Severson: Same thing for the monthly letter. I'll take all of the weekly updates, plop them in here, go through it, and then have it.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Eric Severson: create the copy. And I'll start to send you, uh, the prompts, because the prompts are, you know, a little more sophisticated. The quality of your input.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Eric Severson: Determines the quality of your output.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Eric Severson: I'm doing that in a slightly different way, but similarly here. And so, what I dropped in here was Workforce Commission quote.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Eric Severson: training update, transcript, transcript. Now, in Zoom, every meeting you have in Zoom, there's a full transcript available there. That's gold, right? Because if you ever need to go back.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Eric Severson: and pull out what are the main points. I'll send you the summary from this one. I'm starting to put summaries together.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Eric Severson: It's gonna be a little overkill. You're gonna see a lot of follow-ups and to-dos, and unless we talk about it and agree that everything needs to be done, you can, you know.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Eric Severson: look at them, and if you believe it's important to do, great. If not, fine, right? But the Zoom thing is great, and so I dropped in our last transcript with Richard in that meeting, Tony and here.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and I put in the maritime safety concentration, the PowerPoint from the original launch.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Eric Severson: I got the SAW document that they went in here, and then I put in our… I…

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Eric Severson: fairly regularly scrape the website for all of our programs and all of our courses, so there's a tremendous amount of course information in here.

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and then used AI to say, look at all these knowledge base articles, I want you to pull out of the transcript the request for the 100 words.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:41.000
Eric Severson: And I want 4 versions of it that vary thematically. Now, had I been, you know, taking a little bit more time, I would have refined that to hear the themes that I think are important.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Eric Severson: affordability, uh, you know, I don't know, job opportunity, career mobility, whatever those four things are.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Eric Severson: And that is how I got to these 4.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Eric Severson: Blurbs, all of which will go toward either, something that we can put into.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Eric Severson: Uh, the website, the Signal Mutual landing page, or something that we can give to.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Eric Severson: Um, Richard, what I will do with these is run them through the copy compliance, send them to you, Tony, we can then start the debate back and forth.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Eric Severson: Why am I showing you this stuff? If you, uh, if you haven't started to use projects.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Eric Severson: It takes…

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Eric Severson: It's so much easier to get stuff written by using the context.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Eric Severson: So, AI needs context, background context, what are the most relevant things?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Eric Severson: You put those into a project, you can think of it as in the same way that you organize file folders on your desktop.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:47.000
Eric Severson: And then you can start to query against it, and it just lights out, uh, better.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Eric Severson: Lights out better, so…

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Eric Severson: Okay, that was… that was good for me, that's it. Anything else in the last minute we should be talking about?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Duane Brown: Um, I don't have anything.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Eric Severson: Cool. If you get stuck, call me.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Duane Brown: As of…

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Eric Severson: Okay. And… alright, thanks guys.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Duane Brown: I will, yep.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Tony Atchley: Thank you.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Duane Brown: Thank you.
