WEBVTT

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Eric Severson: Goodbye.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Mike Perry: Well, hello there, Eric, how you doing?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Eric Severson: Doing well today, thank you very much. So…

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Mike Perry: Good, good.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Eric Severson: So, definitely, uh, appreciate the… the look at the slideshow.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Eric Severson: Uh, went through it…

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Eric Severson: Pretty well. I mean, there's a lot, a lot of info here. And so…

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Eric Severson: Sounds like you were heading up the AI thing totally before the COE, is that right?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Mike Perry: That's correct, yes.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, awesome. So, um…

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Eric Severson: The curiosity that I had in the COE is, is there a strategy document for the whole institution.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Eric Severson: And if not, where is that? Should that be part of the framing of all of this?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and then, you know, the only other thing that I'm looking for is.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Mike Perry: Yep.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Eric Severson: Who are the people that are most.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Eric Severson: engaged in using AI around the organization. Um, you know, this is an area that I'm super passionate about, right? I've spent.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Eric Severson: I still have a consulting business that I'm running that is most… mostly sales and marketing, but now I'd say about 90% of it is AI integration and enablement.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Eric Severson: Everything from training to, uh, co-developing to, in some cases, developing solutions for.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Eric Severson: Mostly smaller-sized companies. And so, I'm… I'm on board. I've drank the Kool-Aid, I'm totally immersed in the stuff.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Mike Perry: Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Eric Severson: And so, it sounds like… has that been your journey? What's your… what's your…

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Mike Perry: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so same… so similar, right? So, um, coming out of, um, the Air Force.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Mike Perry: we were on the tail… well, the tail end of the career, uh, we kind of focused on.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Mike Perry: how do we move the Air Force into using more AI to kind of help us kind of streamline some of our functions, which led into warfighting later, but at first it was more automating some of our processes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Mike Perry: So, while I was still serving, I was working on my doctorate, and part of the dissertation focused on, um, you know, strategic foresight and digital transformation.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Mike Perry: So the doctorate focused on emerging technologies and leading through the digital age. So that's what got me into AI and other emerging technologies.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Mike Perry: So I used that to help the Air Force and the first sergeants, and it happened at a crazy time during COVID, so we were able to take some of.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Mike Perry: You know, the digital things that were going on around that time, and transition.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Mike Perry: our… I guess we call it, um, our AFSC, our Air Force Specialty Code for First Hardens, and use AI and technologies to kind of continue our missions across the globe to engage with.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Mike Perry: Our bases and our populations. Uh, so I'm like, man, this is sweet, uh, to be able to use this technology to do these things, so…

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Eric Severson: Sweet.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Mike Perry: I started nerding out on learning any and everything I can about it, and like you, I drank the Kool-Aid.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Mike Perry: So when I got to CSU, um, as an online university, I'm thinking, man, they've been in business 30 plus years.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Mike Perry: and I get in, I'm like, you not… you guys aren't up on…

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Mike Perry: something I… I mean, I'm new to it at the time, so I was kind of shocked that they weren't, so in the conversation with Janelle and Ken.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Mike Perry: who was already thinking that we need to move in that direction, um, once they found out that I had a little bit of experience in it.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Mike Perry: I opened my mouth during a meeting, um, it's kind of… it's kind of how I wound up.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Mike Perry: getting tagged with it, because Janelle was familiar with my, um, final project for my doctoral journey.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Mike Perry: And so, when I started it, there was lots of, um… and I did the same thing you normally do when you're trying to figure out.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Mike Perry: The baseline of where you are, I say, well, you know, what's the motivation for change? And, you know, in academia.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Mike Perry: No one wanted to… AI's cheating. So, the first stage of it was trying to find the momentum to get folks to kind of embrace it. So what I did was.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Mike Perry: Um, with the AI committee, I lobbied to make sure we had people from across the university, right? Staff.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Mike Perry: faculty, program leadership, um, directors, and we wound up having about 30-something people in, and we started training people like Travis, um, Smith.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Mike Perry: He has a brother who's an AI expert, wrote books on it. Jen Steinford had a contact, so we were bringing people in outside the institution.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Mike Perry: who are educating our committee on the benefits of AI. So, after I got… and they were…

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Mike Perry: all in. So once I got them, it took maybe two and a half months.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Mike Perry: to get them playing around with some of the platforms, and so they were in. So once we got there.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Mike Perry: We had a charge that, um, Janelle and Ken gave us, about 5 different things they wanted us to accomplish. That was our…

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Mike Perry: I guess the beginning of our strategy document, and that's what led us into getting out to the things that we had, our buckets.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Mike Perry: So, long story short.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Mike Perry: Once we got that momentum growing with those folks, the plan was for us to come up with, um, um, a proposal.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Mike Perry: Kind of tackle some low-hanging fruit that we can get into right away, go ahead and beta test some things that we were already using within this institution, bring in some new technologies that we maybe hadn't tried yet.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Mike Perry: and see how we can kind of improve some of our processes across academia, and then even on the data side. And I think that's around the time Jason came on board as well.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Mike Perry: Um, and by the end of it, our job, we were tasked with the AI committee.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Mike Perry: to come up with a proposal for how the university should move forward with AI integration.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Mike Perry: But in the meantime, we were making such good progress, because Janelle and Kim were part of the committee.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Mike Perry: We wound up coming out with a policy for AI use. We wound up coming out with some trainings that were already being developed.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Mike Perry: we were… we were making some really, really good progress, but then that's when the DS team stood up.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Mike Perry: And part of our recommendations was to future-proof our institution as we imported integration.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Mike Perry: Um, and the recommendation was for us to come up with a center of excellence eventually.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Mike Perry: But what happened was, it started, and it ended the AI committee, which was really more like a…

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Mike Perry: I guess a work… a task force, um, and then the AI committee picked up, so I… and like I mentioned during the meeting, I think that there was a gap there.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Mike Perry: With the readout that should have led to the strategy document for, hey, here's the recommendations for the committee.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Mike Perry: here's the strategy that we think that the institution should roll with as we integrate AI into, you know, whether it's academics or whatever other parts of the institution we want to roll out with.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Mike Perry: Um, and then, you know, just kind of where we are now. So I think that there's a lot of redundant.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Mike Perry: efforts going on right now under the Center of Excellence without really knowing the full work that the AI community already.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Mike Perry: Accomplished.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Mike Perry: And I think there's a habit of, uh, for a lot of the humbleness of the AI committee members who are part of the AI.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Mike Perry: COE to not want to step on any toes or hurt any feelings and go along with it, if that makes sense, because like, hey, if someone else's baby.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Mike Perry: So, we'll roll with the punches and let it do what it needs to do, is kind of where we are now.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Eric Severson: Well, that explains a lot, because when I read through the deck, I'm like, oh my goodness, I…

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Eric Severson: I… everybody should see this. It is most definitely a ton of work and insight there.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Eric Severson: And I guess my motivation is… I want to…

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Eric Severson: put a little more energy into this. Some days, I feel like we're missing it completely, right? The CO…

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Mike Perry: Mm-hmm.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Eric Severson: The COE meets infrequently and really is focused on.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Eric Severson: you know, there are important policy issues and procedural issues, but I feel like it's moving glacially, and that a framing statement and some just energy, right?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Eric Severson: So, energy around the enabling components of this, uh, are…

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Eric Severson: Missing, or it feels to me like it's missing, right?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Mike Perry: Yeah, I agree. Yeah.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Eric Severson: And I love Jason, I've known Jason, we worked together at Pearson, he's a traditional IT guy, and I think that.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Eric Severson: Right now, we need…

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Eric Severson: But we could do well with an overarching strategy, and maybe even a committee that's focused, like the other one was.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Eric Severson: that provides some high-level direction and energy and prioritization, and then the COE.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Eric Severson: As an orchestration layer can focus on the things that they're focusing on, which are pretty tactical stuff.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Mike Perry: Yes.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Eric Severson: that's not going to change. I mean, again, I'm not… yes, we have to have policy. Yes, we have to have guidelines. I… that is not the reason to get excited about.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Eric Severson: the capabilities of this stuff. It's the transformation that needs to come, but that has to have vision and enthusiasm and strong support.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Mike Perry: Right.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and I would love to help.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Eric Severson: It ignite that, because it just feels a little absent right now.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Mike Perry: Oh, Eric, we had that, and Jason and I had a great conversation after the COE meeting, and, you know, I said… and the same conversation you're having with me, I had with him.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Mike Perry: I said, look, you know, I said, look, this is kind of where we are now. I said, but, you know.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Mike Perry: to the point of… and I tiptoed around it in the meeting, but I said, look, you know, we had the momentum when we had a larger pot of people, and we had the momentum going, and we were pulling people in, that's what we want. When we skinnied it down.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Mike Perry: Now we have a broader scope of people out there that has no idea about what's happening, and then we loosen the buy-in and the momentum that we had at the time.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Mike Perry: So we gotta figure out a way to kind of, um, you know, get people back into the…

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Mike Perry: Into the groove of knowing that, hey, you know, this is CSU's journey into.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Mike Perry: um, making these things happen, not just a small group of folks kind of chipping away, and then I even… and during the AI committee, what we did was.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Mike Perry: we gave them a couple of blueprints. We dropped off, um, in the chat box and in a couple other places in our minutes.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Mike Perry: I use ASU as a benchmark to say, look, this is the copy and paste. They have a whole freaking web page out there with all the stuff that our committee, the COE's working on right now. They already have that built.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Mike Perry: Copy paste. This is easy. They have a COE built and ready, we can take that and say, hey, here's our website.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Mike Perry: here's what we got, and the COE can act as a node for people to kind of filter information through and come in and play around with technologies and do things. So I saw… in my mind, the COE was something different than what it is now.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Mike Perry: Because really, the COE seems more like a… I call it a task force to kind of get after, like you said, something tactical.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Mike Perry: Versus, you know, the COE being this real learning environment where people can come and play and learn and experience and get exposure, and…

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Mike Perry: and all those kinds of things. So I agree with you completely, on…

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Mike Perry: In your, in your line of thinking, so…

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Eric Severson: Well, I would… uh, you can count on me for whatever positive influence I can have. I would even look around and say, is there a precedent somewhere where we can find.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Eric Severson: a steering committee and a COE. So the COE, Jason and the DS group are trained IT people, and they are focused, I think, relentlessly on the data issue.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Mike Perry: Mm-hmm.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Eric Severson: Which is definitely an issue, but it isn't… and yes, it will be… it is super important.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Eric Severson: But the rest of it is just not happening. The enablement, the enthusiasm, and the energy isn't there.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Eric Severson: the use cases aren't there, right? Understanding, asking what people are doing is fine, right? That's okay, but really, it's what problems do you.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Eric Severson: Here's a framework for thinking about problems that this stuff could solve. Where are the bottlenecks in your particular part of the world? And, uh, I…

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Eric Severson: I was relieved to see your deck, because I was sitting here kind of panicking about.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Eric Severson: We're so far behind, as far as I could determine, on even just thinking about.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Eric Severson: You know, where is the innovation around the student experience, the teaching and learning?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Mike Perry: Oh my gosh, Eric, we were there, so in that deck, it even… it looks…

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Mike Perry: pretty good, because the team did a good job, but here's how it was supposed to flow. We're supposed to get in front of, um…

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Eric Severson: Yes.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Mike Perry: Ken and the President's Council.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Mike Perry: Um, in the deck, I was gonna do a quick introduction, and the major part of the presentation was gonna be.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Mike Perry: Tom Heitman walking through, he's gonna pull up and show exact… to your point about the use cases, here's a student's journey.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Mike Perry: here's how we use Synthesia, or whatever. He's gonna take them through and show the bot, or how students utilize the bot. So he's gonna introduce the SEs and teams.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Mike Perry: So, the student side-facing side of what AI does from the student experience, and then…

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Mike Perry: Um, Megan Bowers and team is going to show from the faculty side, and Julia Hart, so we're going to really take them to an immersive experience, what… for how AI can transform.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Mike Perry: CSU. That was what the presentation was supposed to be. And then say, okay, so here's the test… here's the… here's the peek under the curtain of what we can do.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Eric Severson: Well…

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Mike Perry: So, and here's our recommendation for how we move forward, and that goes into the strategy document piece that you were talking about.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Eric Severson: And then there's funding and support, right? And all… now we're into 2026, and I…

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Mike Perry: Exactly.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Eric Severson: I will certainly talk to Caroline about this, and occasionally I get an audience with Ken, and my number 1 issue is.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Eric Severson: You gotta accelerate your engagement on all things AI.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Eric Severson: uh, just have to, right? Because I guarantee, I spent 30 years at a course materials provider, Pearson Education.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Eric Severson: I spent 5 years at a trade school, right? So, at UTI.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Mike Perry: No! Yeah.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Eric Severson: I know where people are innovating like crazy right now, because.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Eric Severson: Empowers smaller groups of people to do a dramatic amount of work.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Mike Perry: Uh, yes.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Eric Severson: And, you know, if you wanted to be anxious about it, there's one or two small players around that get enabled.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Eric Severson: And our main affordability advantage will evaporate because people can afford, you know, the snooze of the world. Those big ticket tuition places are gonna come under duress.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Eric Severson: As these, uh, innovations allow way leaner organizations to come out and compete. And at that point.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Eric Severson: If your affordability thing falls away, that's table stakes, oh my god, and you've got nothing but out-of-the-box blackboard experience, you cannot.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Eric Severson: wait for your LMS provider to do it all, right? They're not going to do it. You can't really wait.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Mike Perry: It's already happened, yeah. It's already happening, and I told… yeah, I sent them a couple articles to Janelle and Misty.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Mike Perry: Well, maybe 5 months ago, because I said, look, you know, yeah, we've been online now, but if you look at what's happening with the other brick and mortar, especially even the Ivy Leagues, they're dipping into the online versions now, because.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Mike Perry: they realize that it's a money pot. And so, when you look at, um, Cornell and eCarnell and what they're doing, you look at MIT and how they're coming out with the credentials and the micro-credentials online, and they're dropping their prices, and I'm like, this is going to become a highly competitive… exactly, this is going to be a highly competitive market at this point.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Eric Severson: That's where we should get nervous.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Mike Perry: Uh, it's gonna get crazy, so…

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, and this is the time to be… I mean, we're already behind, but this is the time to be jacking that up to.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Eric Severson: So, I could imagine a steering committee, sounds like what you guys had, that is really establishing the leadership and the direction on the strategy, and espousing it.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Eric Severson: putting some money aside and figuring out how to enable it. And then this COE is really…

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Eric Severson: focused on preparation, right? Get your data squared away.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Mike Perry: Hmm.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Eric Severson: I've talked to Jason a couple of times about building use cases as opposed to asking people what they're doing, starting to identify how do we build a literacy around.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Eric Severson: The bottlenecks and it's really almost transformation first and then second.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Eric Severson: what are the tools that are most appropriate to go into that? And so…

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Mike Perry: Exactly, yeah.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Eric Severson: And so the part, then, that I get, uh, curious about is, you've definitely covered the educational side and student journey appropriately. I don't see anything for.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Eric Severson: the internal components, so the use cases and bottlenecks that are in marketing, that are in IT, that are roadblocks to.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Mike Perry: Mm-hmm.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Eric Severson: you know, if I wanted to be rough about it, I would say, if you're a CMO, you should triple your output expectations with zero additional headcount. You do have to train them. You have to train them.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Eric Severson: If you're sitting over IT, you should triple your expectation about what that team should be doing, and challenging the notion of buying software over creating it.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Eric Severson: But only after you've enabled that team, both spiritually, this is not the devil's work, this is really important, and then, you know, with the bits and the bytes. And I just don't get the sense that we're.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Eric Severson: We're anywhere on those sorts of comments.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Mike Perry: Well, Eric, if I can speak honestly to you, uh, so when we pulled the team together, I made it a point to bring in.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Mike Perry: people from marketing was on the team, and IT, for the very reason you mentioned, because when we had our priorities listed.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Mike Perry: the first thing I thought about was, since we're online, we have to figure out a way, because if you looked at.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Mike Perry: in the past year or two, where we put a lot of our monies towards our advertising, it was on CSU as a whole.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Mike Perry: So we kept pushing. Look, we have to figure out ways to get out there. We talked about we need a younger population.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Mike Perry: We can't do that if we're on LinkedIn. That's not what a younger population is. Um, and we have to be quicker, uh, we have to move a little bit faster in terms of getting out our marketing products.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Mike Perry: We can't wait weeks for an article on a program we release.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Mike Perry: You know, so we had them on, and quite frankly, I think that, from a marketing standpoint.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Mike Perry: we probably need a little bit more of an outside perspective for some folks who are probably a little bit more steeped in the benefits of AI to come in and help in that.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Mike Perry: Vein to help our marketing team understand. And even… and I'll give you another example. If you look at our marketing program within CSU, our programs.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Mike Perry: you're not gonna see any AI built into those programs, into the lesson plan. It's crazy.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Mike Perry: So…

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Eric Severson: Todd…

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Mike Perry: You know, we need the experience.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Eric Severson: Yep, so the…

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Eric Severson: I agree completely.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Mike Perry: Or the talent, the talent, yeah.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Eric Severson: Totally agree, and so the, you know, in a very small way, the…

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Eric Severson: thing that killed me over here recently was we signed a big partnership agreement with the American Nurses Association, right? 200,000 members.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Mike Perry: Yep.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Eric Severson: And it took 6 weeks to put a landing page together so that we could begin to drive that activity there. And it was all… it was all an inefficient friction in the marketing process.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Eric Severson: And so, a completely… so maybe the way to influence this is to find a way to re-establish that steering committee of executives, seniors.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Eric Severson: And to do exactly what you said, start bringing in, you know, guest speakers to evangelize.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Eric Severson: the benefits of this stuff, because again, I don't… if Jason is supposed to be doing that, we could try it through Jason, but honestly, I think it should be Ken.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Eric Severson: Ken should be leading that as the head of the university, with the level of engagement and importance that it is.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Eric Severson: and then in each of the, you know, again, for me, when he said, I want to focus on optimizing our internal stuff, I thought.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Eric Severson: Here's 15 AI projects that will help your admissions team deal with low staffing and high turnover, right?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Mike Perry: Mm-hmm.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Eric Severson: text bots, voice agents, and, uh, AI, uh…

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Eric Severson: Conversational intelligence off of all of their transcripts will dramatically unlock.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Eric Severson: time, and improve the interaction. Over in Student Support, the same exact kind of thing. We could, you know, all the way to interactive avatars.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Mike Perry: Yes.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Eric Severson: unlocks, it meets the student when and where they are in a way that's unbiased, unfatiguing, and non-judgmental, right? How could you not be.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Eric Severson: Driving down that road. And then just all the other roadblocks internally, uh, around here should be.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Eric Severson: I feel like I want to, you know, ring the fire bell, going, hey, man.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Mike Perry: Yeah, and Jason, when we mentioned it during the COE meeting, um…

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Mike Perry: when we identify the gap, he did mention that, yeah, we need to get that back on the calendar to get in front of Ken and.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Mike Perry: whoever Ken deems the audience to be, because I do think that we need to put what the work.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Mike Perry: the work we've already done in front of them, and like you said, we need some kind of overall strategy, and my guess is, once Ken sees the work that we've already been able to accomplish.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Mike Perry: It will spark. It will… at least he'll know exactly, look, we aren't as far behind as we thought.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Mike Perry: And we need to make sure that the broader audience, management 1 and 2, are aware of the things that are out there.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Mike Perry: Uh, we need to get this same briefing and information and strategy document in front of them, so we got everyone marching to the same tune.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Mike Perry: Um, and then we can kind of get that momentum, and I like the words you used, we need to start evangelizing.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Eric Severson: Yes.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Mike Perry: So, so, uh, we need that momentum. We can allow it to lapse. Um, this is just not the time to allow it to lapse at all.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Mike Perry: Um, so… yeah.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Eric Severson: Okay, well, so whatever I can do, that's my… we're aligned 100%, and I want to, you know, breathe the energy into this thing and get it going at the highest level as possible.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Eric Severson: Um, and, you know, the two things I keep going at Jason about are…

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Eric Severson: We need a plan to build a use case library, Jason, across every division and every department, and so…

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Mike Perry: He got… he got excited about that. Um, who… who would…

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Mike Perry: Who would lead that? I mean, Elwin had a great idea when he brought it up, but would that be something that each department would kind of.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Mike Perry: Have a champion to…

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Eric Severson: So, it's a great question. I mean, I think that, um, I'm not sure. I think that, uh…

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Eric Severson: They're…

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Eric Severson: There could be a… you know, I don't see business analysts in any of the IT functions, and it's a missing gap, and it's somebody…

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Mike Perry: So…

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Eric Severson: That is literate in the business, that can communicate effectively with the constituents in every one of the departments.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Eric Severson: That could lead this sort of thing, right? And I just don't… I don't know that they have that.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Mike Perry: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Mike Perry: No, we don't. We only have, um, business analysts in the business analyst department, which is kind of over there.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Mike Perry: Sit next to Diaz, so… and that's what… who was that? Ed Witherington, I believe, and…

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Mike Perry: that's it, but there's, like you said, there's no tentacles into the actual departments, right? So, if I had to figure out who it would be for us, it would be.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Mike Perry: someone like Misty Kill, who happens to go out there and dig up data herself for academics, and…

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Mike Perry: you know, work closely with folks, so there's no one designated with the ability to go in there for each of those departments to.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Mike Perry: To pull that data on the regular. And plus, the other point about it is, um, they're still parsing through, making sure that the data is.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Mike Perry: sound to…

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Eric Severson: And those can go concurrently, right? The data integrity has to be squared away, right? That's the plumbing. When you flush the toilet, it's got to work nicely, otherwise everybody gets unhappy.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Mike Perry: To use. They can, yeah.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Mike Perry: You got it.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Eric Severson: But the concurrency is… so, they're…

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Eric Severson: For 10 years of my life, I moved out of selling and into a business.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Eric Severson: development role within an organization. So I sat in between IT and the business units.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Eric Severson: And the charge was to ensure that.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Eric Severson: technology products stopped failing at the rate they were, and this was at Pearson. So we built a CRM that was highly customized around the needs of an academic institution's.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Eric Severson: Uh, working on curriculum materials. And we just don't have that kind of person anywhere in the… in the… so I think that conversation starts with Ken about.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Eric Severson: You need part evangelist, highly communicative, low… they don't need to be coders.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Eric Severson: But they need to be committed to going out and working with the business units to help.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Eric Severson: Understand what is a use case, how do we identify it, how do we document it, how do we build that library?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and then it's all… in large organizations, I often see this coming from the Office of Transformation.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Eric Severson: Which is, you know, you have an office of.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Eric Severson: project management, like a PMO, sometimes there, but it kind of evolved to.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Mike Perry: Yep.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Eric Severson: Uh, transformation office that then staffs with those kind of folks that kind of sits between your operational division units and your.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Eric Severson: your, uh, technology organization. I think that's a good conversation for us to try to get on somebody's radar at some point.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Mike Perry: I agree. Um, I am going to figure out a way to send you an invite as a collaborator for that slide deck.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Eric Severson: Perfect. Yeah, perfect.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Mike Perry: That we sent you? Uh, so that way, because I love what you're saying, um, about…

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Mike Perry: Uh, because I think that we need to add that as a recommendation. So, um, I like the use cases, um…

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Mike Perry: And if we're gonna put this as a presentation up for where we need to go, we need…

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Mike Perry: we need to put it in there, right? So, um…

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Eric Severson: I mean, there's…

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Mike Perry: Love to have you as a collaborator on here.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Eric Severson: I'd love it, I'd love it. And again, on just the simple one idea, you know, I'd love to get.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Eric Severson: I know we're almost out of time, so I have one other question before we go on. Okay, okay.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Mike Perry: No, no, I'm good. Yeah, I'm good. I'm just making sure I'm trying to type a note to make sure I don't…

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Mike Perry: Forget to send that to you.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Eric Severson: I would love to see, uh…

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Mike Perry: Alright.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Eric Severson: That conversation in IT as well, because we're… I know of 2 different companies that have.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Eric Severson: Traditionally, when you're doing a use case library, you've got to employ McKinsey or some big consulting firm that charges you arm and a leg.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Eric Severson: And interviews the whole organization.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Mike Perry: Yes.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Eric Severson: voice agents? Voice agents are astonishingly good right now, right? There are companies that are building voice agents that, uh, will interview you.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Mike Perry: Mm-hmm.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Eric Severson: And we'll collect your use case, we'll build up the, you know, all the messy descriptions from all of the people in no organization, cleanse it, create it, organize it, structure it, put it in a database.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Eric Severson: So there are AI tech solutions.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Eric Severson: that have already been built, and frankly, an IT organization that, you know, is building stuff could probably do this pretty easily for us.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Eric Severson: And then you've got, you know, you've got a dogfooding argument, uh, going on in that case.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Eric Severson: There are just so many different ways for us to make that a virtuous loop of looking at AI to build AI solutions to help us figure out how to leverage AI across the enterprise.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Eric Severson: more effectively.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Mike Perry: Yeah. I agree.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Eric Severson: Uh, what's been your experience about using tools internally and getting through? You know, I'm frustrated with the amount of kickback I get from the IT organization. Everything is a no.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Eric Severson: Right? Can I install Whisper Flow? No, you cannot, it's not approved. Whisper Flow, if you haven't… do you know about Whisper Flow?

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Mike Perry: I don't. I don't.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Eric Severson: Voice dictation, we can speak at 120 words per minute, you can type.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
Mike Perry: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Eric Severson: you're super skilled, you can type at 70. This is one of the, it's changed my life sort of technologies. It takes a little while to get used to it. Astonishingly good.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Mike Perry: Mm-hmm.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Eric Severson: I have a giant computer that I sit over here and I work on 90% of the time because the CSU thing is so locked down and so restricted, you can't do stuff.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Eric Severson: So, how have you… have you been able to build a sandbox or get approval for stuff, or no?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Mike Perry: Oh, this is gonna… so this is gonna sound, uh, probably bad, but… so, uh, really, whenever we need something, um, if, uh, Janelle makes it happen, so if we say we need, I've never been…

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Mike Perry: told, no, I can't, right? Whatever I need installed, but what I do, especially if it comes to some stuff I need on the IT side.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Mike Perry: I tend to do it on my own, so I don't use the CSU computer. I have subscriptions to all my AI stuff.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Mike Perry: on my personal computer, I knock it out a lot myself. I get yelled at because I'm using my own funds instead of…

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Mike Perry: You know, but for me, I just don't have time to go with the back and forth of.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Mike Perry: being… I don't like being told no, uh, and I don't like… I don't like to have to wait, right? So… so to… I… for me.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Eric Severson: No.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Eric Severson: Yes.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Mike Perry: I move at the speed of go, so I just kind of just do it on my own, so I haven't had experiences.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Mike Perry: With, um, being told no. I think there was one time, this was maybe a couple years ago.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Mike Perry: when I was attempting to… oh, you know what it was? It was… I was trying to connect my freaking wireless.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Mike Perry: headphones to the CSU thing, and I couldn't do it. I'm like, why can't I connect.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Mike Perry: On my wireless keyboard at home.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Mike Perry: Um, and I was sitting there trying to connect with someone to help me. I was like, you know, this is ridiculous.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Mike Perry: So I ordered me a wired thing, and I use it for CSU, but then I just started using my own.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Mike Perry: Mac instead of the CSU computer, unless I need to do something on Omega when I would get on CSU computer and I do it that way.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Mike Perry: So, it's a sad…

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Mike Perry: time, it's a sad excuse, but that's kind of how I do it. No, I don't think it is, but…

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Eric Severson: It's not just me.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Eric Severson: This is not just me. 90% of my work is over there, because I can sun-restricted as mine, right?

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Mike Perry: No.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Mike Perry: Yeah, and I don't know the… and I guess…

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Mike Perry: I don't know the reason, but I… you're not the only person that said that they've had lots of difficulties. Like, I know a few of my faculty.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Mike Perry: I've complained about trying to download certain things, or have access to certain.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Mike Perry: Um, things that they would like to have to kind of enhance their…

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Mike Perry: Classroom experiences with students, and they don't… they can't do it right then, so they have to wait or put in a ticket.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Mike Perry: Or something to make it happen. And again, they're military-minded folks, so they're not gonna wait on that stuff. They're gonna…

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Mike Perry: Just kind of do it on their own, so…

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Eric Severson: we need a sandbox environment. I mean, one of the things is that there… the speed of innovation is so slow here, it's ridiculous, and it's, frankly, a risk. And there's gotta be a way. You know, I hear all these people talking about, oh, shadow IT, and I think quietly.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Eric Severson: When an institution puts policies ahead of individual success, you're gonna lose, period.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Eric Severson: If your policies prevent individual success, you will lose every single time, right? And that…

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Eric Severson: Shadow IT is, honestly, it's an example of administrative failure. It's leadership failure and administrative failure, and it's happening over here like crazy.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Eric Severson: Because the tools are too good and too empowering and in pockets all over the place, right? And so, that would be my other pitch to Ken is.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Eric Severson: get yourself organized around this, man. Let us help you figure out how to put a sandbox environment in place.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Eric Severson: So that you can have… you can…

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Eric Severson: build literacy internally at a much faster rate. Your best ideas are going to come from the people that are closest to the problems.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Eric Severson: of either student engagement, teaching and learning, you know, marketing, and IT. It's not going to come from an external, but you first have to.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Eric Severson: educate and enable them about possibilities and the boundaries, and then you have to okay some experimentation. And we are so not in that category here, it's…

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Eric Severson: It's, you know, we got…

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Mike Perry: You know, it would… it would be interesting to request from Scott Oswald and team, um, the number of, um.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Mike Perry: Ticket request that's come in with people asking for…

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Mike Perry: Um, different types of things, and just see how many have been approved, disapproved, and the rationale, reasons behind. He has to have all that data, right? So…

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Mike Perry: And I think that'll be a telltale sign to…

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Eric Severson: Got it.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Mike Perry: to, uh, to show Ken, say, look, here's what people are asking for.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Mike Perry: They have to have pretty good reasons why. Let's take a deeper dive into this and figure out, are we missing the mark on a few things?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Eric Severson: Or let's have an exception policy, a process that documents it, puts it together, makes you aware of it, right? Because again.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Eric Severson: you got Janelle, I do not have the benefit of someone that will loudly argue on our behalf for this at this point, and so…

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Eric Severson: Uh, so, other ways to say, let's make it visible. Transparent sunlight disinfects everything. Let's make it transparent so people can see, hey, this is…

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Eric Severson: An important thing to be struggling with a little bit more.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Eric Severson: Okay. Well, last thing, the strategy that I've started to use, and it is not a gentle strategy.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Mike Perry: Okay.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Eric Severson: But, uh, with marketing, it took 6 weeks to build a landing page for the American Nursing Association. 6 weeks.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Eric Severson: It took me about 6 hours to build a landing page builder, yes, exactly.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Mike Perry: I'm gonna say, you can go to… go to GoDaddy!

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Mike Perry: Right.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Eric Severson: And then a compliance checker, so that every piece of copy runs through a compliance checker and comes out with a grade, a report, an audit, and an improved.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Eric Severson: bit of copy, so that as Duane and Tony and my team, or Jim, put marketing requests in, I'm giving them an audit report to include with it, and images of exactly what we want.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Eric Severson: to try to reduce the amount of friction as we're moving through this. And so, and then I'm showing them. Here, I did it in Copilot, which sucks, but here it is in… in Claudet, or in Gemini in a Gem, or in ChatGPT as a custom GPT. There's a million ways to do it.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Eric Severson: I'm not a programmer, I'm an English major, I'm a sales guy, so the, you know, the hurdles are.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Eric Severson: Quickly falling away to the curious, let's get going on some of this to move.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Eric Severson: the friction out, and now I'm down to, here, I did it. I built it, look, take a look. I don't want to be the builder, I want you guys to be the builder.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Mike Perry: Yeah, I mean, it'll literally write the code for you, give the… I mean, it…

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Mike Perry: I mean, this is way… today is way easy, so if it's taking 6 weeks to do anything, someone's doing something wrong.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Eric Severson: Yes, exactly, and it came down to bandwidth and approval.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Eric Severson: Both of those are, you know, things that you can… you can potentially improve through these tools, so…

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Eric Severson: Thank you for talking to me about this. Uh, I'm super excited to, again, breeze some energy and enthusiasm back into this. I love getting a steering committee going again.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Eric Severson: and then just maybe figuring out… maybe Jason can bring that forward, and I can talk to Jason about how…

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Eric Severson: How, uh, beneficial it will be to have that senior level.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Eric Severson: setting priorities and making directional things. And again, if he pushes back on that.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Eric Severson: Okay, but at least that's a… one… what do you think about that, as a way to get that steering committee back in… in…

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Eric Severson: constituted.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Mike Perry: Yeah, I think that… well, he said he would mention it, but, um, I'm already in the process. I want to have a conversation with you first, but I'm already gonna send a message back to, um.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Mike Perry: Janelle and Ken say, hey, just a heads up, here's where we are with the, um… because we did identify the gap, right? So, Ken, we never did get in front of you with what we did, so we love.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Mike Perry: To have the opportunity for… to close out the work that 32, 33 of your.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Mike Perry: Um, employees did, over the course of about 13 months.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Mike Perry: with the AI Committee, um, so we'd love to have that opportunity. And I think that'll open the door for that to happen, and it won't be stepping on toes, so to speak.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Eric Severson: Oh, perfect.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Mike Perry: And Jason was part of that committee as well, right? So… so, I mean, he was an advisor on it, so it… and he's aware, we had a conversation, so…

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Eric Severson: Okay, good. Sweet.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Mike Perry: Um, and I wouldn't email or reach out to them without having him on the… on the CC line, so…

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Eric Severson: Okay, cool. Then I'll… I will do nothing, but be it… be enthusiastically.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Mike Perry: Yeah, I… I'm…

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Eric Severson: present. Uh, the other thing I was gonna take a look at is, in the deck that you have.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Eric Severson: Is… is it… does it include the non-educational parts of CSU?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Eric Severson: So, marketing, IT, uh, student support, you know.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Eric Severson: Outreach. B Dev.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Mike Perry: Uh, you know, I gotta go back and look now, because I think that it was… when… it was a broader stroke to it, so it was faculty and staff, right? So, if you think faculty and staff.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Mike Perry: it was kind of supposed to be all-encompassing, so when you got to the portions where it talked about, under Dr. Hart's team, when it was talking about faculty and staff training.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Mike Perry: that was across the board, but they didn't specify that there was going to be training for marketing, right? They didn't specify it was going to be training for IT.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Mike Perry: Because we didn't get that far into the weeds of who was going to get what training outside of… really, the focus at the time, Janelle wants to focus on the academic and student-facing side of the house, so…

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Eric Severson: Sure.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Mike Perry: Um, that's definitely something that we need to add to it, because, to your point.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Mike Perry: That… that… there's a need, there's a gap there.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Eric Severson: There's a little bit of a gap there, and it aligns perfectly to what Ken was talking about in terms of internal optimization, and frankly, it's an area that I'm both experienced in and.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Eric Severson: and passionate in, right? Uh, in the… the unsexy, or the, you know, the back office part, uh, I think it's more appropriate to put the money and focus on the student experience, but…

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Eric Severson: There's still upside to all the, you know.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Mike Perry: So, what I want to do then, if you're okay with it, um…

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Mike Perry: I think that that's a strong, um…

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Mike Perry: category, um, that didn't get a lot of attention, but is a huge part of what we do at CSU.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Mike Perry: So when we get the green light to do something more with the subcommittee.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Mike Perry: Um, we'd love to have you…

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Mike Perry: Back with us, with the subcommittee stand-up, and maybe that's an effort, if you have the bandwidth, that you can.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Mike Perry: You can share.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Eric Severson: I would, I would love that. Again, I spent 10 years at Pearson building an organization.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Eric Severson: That did that, that sat in between the business users and the…

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Eric Severson: IT organization, and it was almost all internally focused, right? So, our products at Pearson were textbooks or educational materials.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Eric Severson: That was the equivalent of the academic environment, and that was handled separately. All I did was all of the internal staff facing.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Eric Severson: tools and optimizations, it was mostly sales and marketing, but it was a decade of my career that I took a, you know, a step out of the primary selling and business development role and did that, and loved it, had a great time with it. And so.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Mike Perry: Yeah.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Eric Severson: You know, experienced and passionate about those things that many people will find to be unsexy, so…

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Mike Perry: I love it, I love it. Okay, so I will, between tonight and tomorrow, send a note to Ken and Janelle. I'll give Janelle a heads up with a text.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Mike Perry: I'll be at CSU next week, so I'll find some time to sit with both of them, too, and go into more detail.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Mike Perry: Um, and… and we'll… we'll reignite this then.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Eric Severson: Perfect. Al should actually be around later part of the week, too. I'm going to the space thing in Tallahassee with Jim and Tony on Tuesday.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Eric Severson: And then I'm driving over to CSU for the rest of the… rest of the week, so I may run in.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Mike Perry: Okay.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Mike Perry: Well, I'll see you next week. Yeah.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, perfect. Alright, thanks a ton.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Mike Perry: Alright, brother, see you later.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Eric Severson: Talk soon.
