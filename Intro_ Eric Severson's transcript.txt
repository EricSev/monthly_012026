00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Eric Severson: How am I…

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Eric Severson: My outlook is all locked up, of course.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Eric Severson: Uh, these idiot messages keep popping up.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Eric Severson: Uh… now I'm talking to Tony.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Eric Severson: Dang.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Eric Severson: I can't… I don't know what the is wrong with this. Do you get those messages that pop up the warnings about meetings?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, yeah, yeah, down in the right-hand corner, or…

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Eric Severson: Well, for me, it's… it's… it's up… I'm gonna try to shut off all of Outlook and see what happens.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Eric Severson: Come on…

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Eric Severson: I was scheduling another meeting, the one with Misty, and this idiot box came up, and it won't go, and now I can't tell.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Eric Severson: Hang on a second, Tony, if I get disconnected, I'll call you back. I can't tell if I forgot to put Tom in the meeting.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Tony Atchley: I saw him in there earlier.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Eric Severson: Oh, good.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Tony Atchley: When I pull that up…

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Eric Severson: Maybe I can get rid of my Outlook problem, there we go, and not lose the meeting, that's good.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Tony Atchley: It shows him in there, and… yeah.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Tony Atchley: Yep.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Tony Atchley: There it comes.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Eric Severson: Perfect.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Tom Heitman: Hey, guys.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Tony Atchley: Hey, Tom.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Eric Severson: Uh-huh.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Tom Heitman: Sorry about that.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Eric Severson: No worries at all. Now, have we met, uh, everyone, there's a lot of bearded guys at, uh, CSU, so…

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, I know, right?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Eric Severson: I'm not sure if we've actually met before.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Tom Heitman: I don't know. There's…

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Eric Severson: I don't think so. I'm new-ish to CSU.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Tom Heitman: Okay.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Eric Severson: And I joined, uh, to work with Tony and Dwayne on Caroline's team, so we're…

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Tom Heitman: Oh, nice.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Eric Severson: Yep, very exciting, doing a bunch of business development stuff.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Tom Heitman: Okay.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah. Good deal.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Eric Severson: And there were two sort of reasons that I wanted to spend a little bit of time with you. One.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Eric Severson: We've got a couple of partnership deals that are…

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Eric Severson: Very exciting, and uh… and include some custom curriculum in it.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Eric Severson: So I want to talk to you about those, but even more broadly, I'm just super interested in.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Tom Heitman: Okay.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Eric Severson: Uh, all things IDT, so that as we are talking with partners.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Eric Severson: about custom curriculum, I'm saying the right thing. I'm not… I'm not putting us out over a barrel, or saying things that are just not good.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Tom Heitman: Sure.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Eric Severson: correct. I do have a fair amount of education experience. I worked for 30 years for Pearson Education. I was in a variety of different roles.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Tom Heitman: Okay.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Eric Severson: head of sales for higher ed, so in those… in that capacity, I went through the physical to digital transition, so we were very involved in the first LMSs that were out there, in building the.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Eric Severson: Content cartridges, if you've ever seen the My Labs or the Mastering Series.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Eric Severson: I sold those for decades, and so I know about supporting faculty with those things, and have a, you know, working knowledge of what does it take to build.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Eric Severson: you know, basic Blackboard, uh, or course management stuff. But here, I was definitely curious to… to… just to hear.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Tom Heitman: Sure, sure.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Eric Severson: how does it… how does IDT work here? What should we be thinking about on the front end of it when we're talking with partners, especially about customizing curriculum?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Tom Heitman: Sure, sure. So, uh, first of all, yes, we actually… we use MyLabs, we use Mastering.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Tom Heitman: We obviously go way back with Pearson. Pearson is our biggest vendor when it comes to… I call it learning resources now, textbooks, whatever you want to call it.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Tom Heitman: Um, so we have a pretty good relationship with Pearson, um, but…

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Tom Heitman: All that to say, we don't discriminate against any vendors. I mean, we use Cengage, we use McGraw-Hill, we use Sage, we use… you name it, we probably have something with them.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Tom Heitman: Um, but obviously that's not where all of our curriculum and resources come from.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Tom Heitman: Um, so just a quick, quick overview of IDT, just at a high level.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Tom Heitman: Um, we can… there's 35 of us. Uh, we are a remote team at this point in time.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Tom Heitman: Um, myself and the Associate Dean, Elizabeth McWinney, we go into the office Tuesdays and Thursdays, but everybody else is…

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Tom Heitman: Scattered throughout the country.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Tom Heitman: Um… we have 3 main teams within IDT. We have the instructional design team.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Tom Heitman: We have the editing team, and we have the course technology team.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Tom Heitman: Um, and that's kind of the linear process course development follows.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Tom Heitman: So… I can kind of walk you through what it looks like to develop.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Tom Heitman: a course, a CSU course that you as a student would take.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Tom Heitman: But before I do that.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Tom Heitman: We do… you were talking about curriculum and, you know.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Tom Heitman: partnerships and opportunities and things like that. Just because we follow a process and we create courses for CSU doesn't mean we don't… like, right now, we have 4 different projects going on that.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Tom Heitman: are completely different from the CSU model. Uh, so just because we do things a certain way for CSU doesn't mean when you're talking to.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Tom Heitman: Someone about an opportunity, we can customize pretty much anything and do it however they want us to do it.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Tom Heitman: Or, if they don't know how they want to do it, we can partner them with somebody on our team and be like, what do you think about this? Or this is… this works with this different type of subject area, and…

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Tom Heitman: you know, here's some examples, that kind of thing, so…

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Tom Heitman: We're fine thinking outside the box as well, so I kind of wanted to put that out there first, but typical day in the life of IDT is.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Tom Heitman: Um… obviously, you know, Tony knows, everybody knows, we're going nuts with new programs, so a majority of what we're doing right now is new content, new courses.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Tom Heitman: And, um, really how that works is academics on the front end, the deans, program directors, they get together, they say, this is what we want to do.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Tom Heitman: Um, they work with Wendy Styren in Learning Resources to find out what textbooks are available, what learning resources are available, what labs are available. Maybe sometimes the academic program director or one of the faculty members has an idea, they say.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Tom Heitman: hey, there's this product out here that works great for X, and we talk about that, and there's a series of meetings that go on kind of before any development starts.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, and they put together, um, what's called a course resource form.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Tom Heitman: that has the course description, course outcomes, any resources that are going to be used. Uh, if I'm boring you at any point, just stop me and say I don't care about this stuff, but…

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Tom Heitman: I promise this will only take 5 minutes. So, we do… we kind of have that, it goes through the UCC University Curriculum Committee, gets approved, and then it comes to us, Elizabeth specifically.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Eric Severson: Perfect.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Tom Heitman: And she pairs a course writer who is typically a faculty member, but a subject matter expert in the field.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Tom Heitman: She pairs them with an instructional designer.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Tom Heitman: And they have 10 weeks to design that course. It all goes into a big Word document at this point in time. We're trying some other things this year, but right now.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Tom Heitman: It's what's called an instructional packet, and that's where all the curriculum and all the content of the course goes first. So, they map all the outcomes to the assignments.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Tom Heitman: They put in all the assessment questions, they put in any unit lessons, everything goes in there. Obviously, there's SharePoint OneDrive on the back end to capture supplemental resources, but for the most part, it's all outlined in a document. That takes about 10 weeks. It does have a peer review process.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Tom Heitman: Um, so when the ID's finished with that, they pass it to another ID, they review it.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Tom Heitman: The academic program director signs off on it, and it's passed to the editing team.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Tom Heitman: The editing team spends a week, week and a half going through it. Are all the T's crossed, all the I's dotted? Are all the commas in the right place? But they do much, much more than that.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Tom Heitman: They… you wouldn't think it, but we've had issues with plagiarism in the past.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Tom Heitman: uh, faculty member says, I'm gonna take the easy way out, I'm just gonna copy and paste a chapter of this textbook and throw it in a document and send it on, and…

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Tom Heitman: Um, or, you know, they don't quite understand what paraphrasing is, so they, they have this article, they want to use it, they're doing it innocently, but, you know.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Tom Heitman: Hey guys, we can't do that, kind of a deal. They also look for ADA compliance, that's a big deal for us.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Tom Heitman: making sure that everything is accessible to all students, um, working with the Office of Disability Services where we need to, to make sure that that's all tied up.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Tom Heitman: Um, and so that takes a week, week and a half. Uh, and then they pass it to our course technology team, who takes that instructional packet that they've been working on.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Tom Heitman: And for a week, week and a half, they, um, load everything into Blackboard, make sure that it all works, um…

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Tom Heitman: They have what's called the build, and then the final review. Someone comes behind that.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, it's deployed to Blackboard, and then, um, it's copied, the sections are copied.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Tom Heitman: And then about 3 weeks before the course starts, the faculty get access to those sections that they're going to be teaching.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Tom Heitman: They can load up their…

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Tom Heitman: Discussion board questions, or tweak their professor profiles, or add whatever it is that they want, and then…

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Tom Heitman: it's launched to the students. Um, and we do that 11 times a year, obviously. You know, we have 11 terms. Um, we've been breaking records with the number of sections that we've been running. We've had over a thousand sections in some of the B terms.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Tom Heitman: So there's a lot that goes to it, but that instructional packet sets us up for success for all the SAX narratives, for anybody that comes in and audits anything, because it's got all that.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Tom Heitman: It's got all the alignment for the outcomes, um, it's got all the check marks that the… saying that the academic program director and the teaching faculty signed off on this course, the content is good, it wasn't just.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Tom Heitman: random Tom Heitman writing this course, you know? Um, and then we have shifted to where.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Tom Heitman: We base everything off the Quality Matters rubric, so all courses.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Tom Heitman: are up to Quality Matters standards. Um, they're not all stamped as Quality Matters, because that costs money, and it takes time to do that.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Tom Heitman: Um, but we have 84 courses, QM officially certified, and we continue to.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Tom Heitman: put more through the process every year. We usually get 10 to 15 through.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Tom Heitman: process. Um, so, from a technical standpoint.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Tom Heitman: Um, that's kind of what we do. Um, if you're asking, okay, well, what are our courses mainly consist of? I don't know, I mean, have you… have you seen many of our courses in Blackboard?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Eric Severson: You know, I haven't even… I'm new enough to not have even asked, can I log into Blackboard as a…

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Tom Heitman: Sure. Is that something…

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. Can I log in to Blackboard?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, I think everybody can, but if not, we can certainly get you… we can figure that out, for sure. Yeah, I mean, that's no problem at all.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Eric Severson: Oh.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Eric Severson: So, no, no, I have not, but I would like to, because again, part of what we have to do is describe the student experience for people, and you know, I can do good enough based on 30 years of higher education sales, but it would be good to be able to see.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Tom Heitman: Right.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Eric Severson: Everybody's got a little bit of a different approach, so…

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Tom Heitman: So I can definitely get you in there and make you kind of a demo dummy copy of a course that you can play around in and just kind of see how it is, but I will tell you, um, one of the things that students have really responded to over the years that I've been here.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Tom Heitman: is… our courses have a very consistent model. They're all set up… content's obviously not all the same.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Tom Heitman: But everything's in the same spot. They're always gonna know where the syllabus is, they're always gonna know what to expect in each one of the units, because there's 8 units in our courses, right?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Tom Heitman: And for the most part, they all follow the same formula.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, Unit 1 has an introduction discussion board, um, and then it's got a knowledge… it's got content, and then a knowledge check kind of quiz.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Tom Heitman: Section 2, or Unit 2 has a live lecture component. All the courses now have to have that live lecture component where the student is actually getting to know the faculty member.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, they can go in and ask questions, the faculty member can kind of discuss what's coming up in the course, and the key points to.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Tom Heitman: jot down as they work through it. Um, Unit 3 is the first, like, assignment that the student has to do.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Tom Heitman: And then Unit 4 is kind of a journal reflection. Up to this point, what have you learned, and how can you apply that in whatever field you're.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Tom Heitman: in, kind of a deal. And then it repeats itself. 5 is the discussion board, 6 is the live lecture, 7 is the assignment, and 8 is the…

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Tom Heitman: Now, that can change a little bit, but for the most part, that's…

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Tom Heitman: I mean, that's the consistent workflow of a course, and um…

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Tom Heitman: We try to do our best to set the faculty up for success in teaching that, so each unit is going to have.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Tom Heitman: Some kind of unit lesson in it that allows the faculty to link their experiences with the concepts that are being taught within that particular course.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Tom Heitman: Um, sorry if you're here. We got a new puppy today, and she's going nuts in the other room.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Eric Severson: Ah, good for you!

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, apparently, my wife left her to go pick up our son from school, so she's not happy about that. But, um…

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Tom Heitman: They all have a unit lesson, some of them are videos, some of them are audio clips, some of them are narrated PowerPoint, some of them are just static written lectures with images and things, but.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Tom Heitman: You know, the point of those is, okay, you're reading about this in the textbook, or you're learning about this in my lab, or whatever.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Tom Heitman: that's great, but you're my professor. Why is that important, and what have you done in the past to be successful that maybe I could learn from you.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Tom Heitman: By taking this course, kind of a deal, right? Um, and then we try to supplement that with authentic assignments. So, not all of our courses are just read the book, answer the questions. Depending on what it is.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Tom Heitman: you know, Tony, you and I were at that fire conference, remember? Like, you know, a lot of our fire courses.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Tom Heitman: We got firefighters that want to be officers, right? Well, a lot of, as we all know, as we move up, there's more and more paperwork that has to be done, so…

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Tom Heitman: Why not give them a scenario, but then based on what happens in that scenario, here are the forms that you would typically fill out, this is how you fill them out, these are the key players, this is who you turn it into, this is how it should be formatted. Like, so we're trying to give them.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Tom Heitman: You know, that experience. Obviously, you can do so much in the online environment, but, like, trying to at least give them those skills so that whenever they go for whatever job that is.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Tom Heitman: you know, they at least know what that is. Um, I don't know if y'all heard this morning, Jackie and.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Tom Heitman: The leadership talking about the PowerPoints. Everybody hates the PowerPoints. Well, thank God somebody used a PowerPoint, because.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Tom Heitman: You know, like, there's PowerPoints out there, but, you know, I mean, a big part of business is you have to give a presentation about, you know, your numbers that quarter, or, you know.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Tom Heitman: If you're in marketing, you have to give a presentation about the product that you're pushing, or, you know, whatever, so…

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Tom Heitman: We do try to keep in mind that, um, there are specific skills in certain areas that.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Tom Heitman: these students need to know, and so we try to do the best that we can. Now.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Tom Heitman: just like any big successful business, there's a lot of change, there's a lot of, okay, we're gonna try this, we're gonna try that. So, you know, not everything's perfect, but, um…

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Tom Heitman: We have a ticket system, much like IT, to where if faculty or a student or whoever finds an issue, or they find that an assignment's not really working, a lot of students are struggling with it, they can submit that ticket, we go in.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Tom Heitman: We assign somebody to it, and we update that particular piece of the course. So…

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Tom Heitman: That's kind of how we work. It's, you know, in instructional design, there's the evaluation process, and you're always evaluating, and so that's what I feel like we're doing. You can always get better, right? And there's always some…

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Tom Heitman: New thing coming down the pike.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Tom Heitman: for instance, I showed in leadership a while back, you know, they have the new AI chatbot feature in Blackboard, where you can set up a scenario and you can actually interact with the chat. So we've been…

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Tom Heitman: Toying with that and putting that out in a limited number of courses, seeing how students react to that.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, we got a software with AI avatars where they talk to you on screen and do different things, and so we've been experimenting with that.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Tom Heitman: Um, that's not in all courses, but, you know, you gotta start somewhere, and you only have the capacity to do so much of that at one time, but I feel like we're trying to innovate as we go.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Tom Heitman: While keeping that consistent, flexible model that the students have come accustomed to, so…

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Tom Heitman: I know I've been blowing a lot of wind, so I'll stop for a minute and see. Was that even what you were looking for, or did I just waste…

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Eric Severson: No, that was… yes, yes, yes, but definitely we want to get to the…

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Tom Heitman: 19 minutes over time.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Eric Severson: the custom part of this conversation, but I had a couple of quick questions, so…

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Tom Heitman: Sure.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Eric Severson: Uh, do…

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Eric Severson: Do you have, uh, people that do the assessments, that create assessments, if they're not coming out of a publisher, or do the faculty have to do that?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Tom Heitman: We… the instructional designers do that. They… they… well, they partner with the…

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Eric Severson: They do the testing and the quizzes.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Tom Heitman: So, a lot of times, how it works is…

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Tom Heitman: The faculty don't… they know what they want to teach, and they know what they want the students to get out of the course, but they don't know how to go about getting there.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Tom Heitman: And so that's where the IDs come in and say, you know, they say, well, this subject, let's just create a test. Are you sure you want to create a test, or do you want to create some other type of assessment?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Tom Heitman: To… to measure those skills. Uh, so we have a… we have a group that does that.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Eric Severson: So, is every ID an assessment, uh, skilled assessment person, or do you have specialized assessment folks?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Tom Heitman: I mean, academics has a whole department just on assessment. I mean, John Hope is our assessment guy.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Eric Severson: Assessment.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, John came from Instruction. He was me in 2000…

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Tom Heitman: 14, 15, 16, and he moved to academics to just be over assessment, and all he does is work with rubrics.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Tom Heitman: General education competencies, uh, measuring assessment, uh, he…

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Tom Heitman: If we ever have any kind of issue, we go to him, but…

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Tom Heitman: Every single one of our instructional designers, when it comes to actually taking the learning outcomes.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Tom Heitman: and assessing them some way with some sort of tool or medium, that's what we do every day. I mean, yeah, all of our IDs are skilled in that, and that's what they do. They create those different types of assessment.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Tom Heitman: To measure those outcomes.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Eric Severson: Uh, so the… awesome. So that was perfect, and I wanted… the second set of questions are about…

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Eric Severson: You know, when we're talking about new learning partners, or we're at a conference, and we're representing CSU.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Eric Severson: almost always, the question about how are you thinking about implementing AI comes up. So you hit two things that are enormously helpful for us just to hear. The chatbot that sits inside of, uh…

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Tony Atchley: Oh.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Eric Severson: Blackboard, and then the avatar. What are you doing? Who are you using for avatars?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Tom Heitman: So, we signed a contract with Synthesia, uh, Robert Cunningham mentioned it earlier today.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Eric Severson: I saw that today, yeah, I saw his…

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Tom Heitman: Um, and really what that does is allows us to either create custom avatars, so, like, we create avatars of each other.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, with, you know, a little CSU logo on our shirt, or whatever. Um, or they have, I think it's, like, 1,200 prefabricated avatars, and you can build.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Tom Heitman: lessons around those avatars. Uh, if you take the annual training, and you take the, uh…

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Tom Heitman: the anti… which I think is funny on an online school, but I know it's there, the anti-hazing module.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Tom Heitman: you'll kind of see that in action, where a person comes up and talks to you and talks about the points on the screen. It's basically avatars that we can create presentations around.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Tom Heitman: Um, what we're working on and exploring, and we haven't quite got there yet.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Tom Heitman: Is where you…

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Tom Heitman: ask a question, and the avatar talks back to you. Like, right now, that's all in, like, Word form.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Tom Heitman: Um, but we're trying to work with Synthesia, and I don't have a timeline on this, it's just something that we're kind of…

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Tom Heitman: Going back and forth with them on of, like, to where you could actually have someone.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Tom Heitman: In that course at all time, where you could ask them a question, and then you can actually kind of talk back and forth to them.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, problem with that is that gets pricey.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. Yeah.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Tom Heitman: Um, and so, we're taking small steps to try to…

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Tom Heitman: Figure out ways to.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Tom Heitman: Spruce up the courses while not being left behind. I think, you know, if we don't use some of these tools, we're gonna get left behind.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Tom Heitman: But it goes further than just the technology glitz and glamour pieces, you know, um…

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Tom Heitman: I had the privilege of serving on the AI committee. Tony, are you on that? I feel like you're on that. Or you're on that?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Eric Severson: I am.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Tony Atchley: No, Eric is, yeah.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Eric Severson: Hi, I mean…

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, and so, I don't know why they haven't posted all those policies.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Eric Severson: Been a while since we've had a meeting, hasn't it?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Tom Heitman: Right, but all those, like, policies and procedures that that group came up with. So, I mean, I think that's an important piece that we need to get out in front of our students, and really anybody who asks about it. Like, not only are we trying to use these tools, but we're trying to use them responsibly, and we do have policies in place, and we do have…

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Tom Heitman: Expectations for not just the students and how they use it, but staff and how they use it, and let people know that, yeah, we're using it to accentuate our content, but we're not using it to just generate all of our content, that type of thing.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Tom Heitman: Um, I mean, we do have…

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Tom Heitman: uh, team… it's not Team GPT anymore, it was bought by somebody, and they… it's something else now, but, like, you know, we do use…

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Tom Heitman: Team ChatGPT to help with some of the, um, you know, words, some of the content, and things like that, but…

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Eric Severson: Sure. Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Tom Heitman: I create little videos and stuff like that, but…

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Eric Severson: And…

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Tom Heitman: You know.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Eric Severson: So, super helpful for us to stay…

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Eric Severson: in touch with how you're thinking about the student experience and or efficiencies in the back office, right? I heard Ken talk about that this morning as well.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Eric Severson: And then also, just for me personally, so, uh, I have…

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
Eric Severson: For the 2 years prior to joining.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Eric Severson: CSU, I was operating as a consultant, and that became an AI consultant.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Tom Heitman: Okay.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Eric Severson: So I've done a bunch of things in sales and marketing, and I still have a couple of clients that I continue to work with.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Eric Severson: that I had projects that were partway through.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Eric Severson: Avatars is one, as a… I've been a sales leader for over 30 years, and so sales training with avatars is a huge part of the opportunity with AI.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Eric Severson: Have you looked at Hey Jen? Have you heard of HeyGen ever?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, we've looked at HeyGen, and Synthesia does a lot of the same things it does, but yeah, HeyGen…

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Eric Severson: Agent, a little ahead on the interactive side. I like Synthesia, we use… I'm also the COO for a small startup, a group of.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Tom Heitman: Um…

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Eric Severson: former EdTech friends, and we use Synthesia for all of the onboarding, all of the…

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Eric Severson: training, uh, and it's a little nicer, I thought, presentation, but…

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Eric Severson: Hey Gen's definitely ahead on that interactive, although it gets pricey, right?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah. Right. And…

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Tom Heitman: That's what we did when we kind of looked at some of these tools. We just had to wait, like, what did we want now?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Tom Heitman: And we didn't want to lock ourselves into a long-term contract, either. Um, and I agree, HeyGen had a little more…

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Tom Heitman: options when it came… I mean, since these are really just presentation, like, that's… that's it, you know? It's got more features now, I mean, they keep adding things, but like, hey, Jen, you're right. I mean, there's a little more…

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Tom Heitman: Around it, a little more robust features, um…

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Eric Severson: I did role-play applications in ENCE and HeyGen.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Tom Heitman: But I don't… I don't…

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Eric Severson: But it got to be too expensive for the client, because, you know.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Eric Severson: Again, it wasn't more expensive than a live trainer doing a role play.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Eric Severson: But it was still a ticker going, and it was early, early days. They're so much better now. It was maybe too…

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Eric Severson: you know, big version upgrades, less, and it was a little glitchy, so it was… but it's super cool stuff, that, and voice, I'm doing voice with.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Eric Severson: to other, uh, clients where, you know, that might be an interesting thing to think about. The latency is lower, the cost is lower, you don't have the visual stuff, and so…

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Eric Severson: That is to the point now where, you know, I'm telling clients, I really think you should tell people this isn't a human, this is an AI that they're talking with, and I don't think that's the right way to go about it.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Eric Severson: And the CEO looked at me and said, they don't have any idea. Why should I tell them?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Eric Severson: I'm like, I don't know, I think maybe we should probably tell them, but… but that technology is really getting good, the voice.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Eric Severson: Uh, the voice stuff, and so you can do… that might be a way to support students, uh, in there.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Eric Severson: So, we have a couple of…

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Eric Severson: deals that are, uh, kind of like LiveView, right, technology. I don't know if that's hit your desk yet, but the…

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Tom Heitman: Oh yeah, we're about done with the first course for that, yeah.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Eric Severson: Well, tell us about that. How did that, uh, process go from, uh, you know, description through, you know, first course?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Tom Heitman: So, the way that these usually come across my desk are Misty sends them to me, she sends me the MOU.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Tom Heitman: She sends me some details on what we're gonna do with this one. I think they wanted.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Tom Heitman: One of the micro-credentials done for a conference that you guys, I guess, are probably going to in March.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Tom Heitman: Um, so they wanted it done by February, or maybe it's in February, I don't know, they wanted it done by February.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Tom Heitman: And so, uh, she sent that to us, and I asked her some questions, and this particular case.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Tom Heitman: She's like, oh, set it up like the ODP courses, the, uh, officer development program courses we did for the IAFC.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Tom Heitman: Um, and basically, what I do is take that back, I say, alright, how many hours is this going to be? Is it 10 to 30 hours? Is it a typical.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Tom Heitman: 150 hour course, like, what does this look like? Um, what kind of…

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Tom Heitman: structure do you want? Do you want it to be units? Does it need to be modules? How long do they need to be?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Tom Heitman: What do they need to entail? So we have a kickoff meeting, basically, where I just ask all my questions. Um, I don't have an official checklist, but I kind of have.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Tom Heitman: the same questions that I ask every time. A lot of it is also, like.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Tom Heitman: do we brand this in any way? You know, does this go in Blackboard, or is this an external? We have iSpring. Have you used iSpring, Eric?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Eric Severson: No, never even heard it.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Tom Heitman: You heard of, uh, Captivate, or, um, Storyline, or…

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Tom Heitman: it's a course authoring tool that allows you to build learning modules, but it's outside Blackboard.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Tom Heitman: So, it's got some of those AI avatar-type features that's embedded into… it's not as robust as, like, a Synthesia or a HeyGen, but you can kind of create… we tell people it's PowerPoint on steroids, but the point is.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Tom Heitman: You know, we can create a standalone product that's branded just for them, um…

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Tom Heitman: And so, sometimes it's that, or sometimes there's a partnership where they're like, nope, we want you to push it through Blackboard.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Tom Heitman: Um, so we'll work with you to give you the content, um, and then you… you create it in Blackboard, and then you…

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, continuing education is the one that, you know, manages the students that come in and everything.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Tom Heitman: So we ask all those questions, and determine what the needs are, and then we treat it a little bit like.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Tom Heitman: A regular course by using that, like, instructional packet, and so we'll get one of the instructional designers on board with whoever.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Tom Heitman: the contact is, um… or a lot of times it's just, like, one of our deans or program directors, like this one, I know that Jason's been working with.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Tom Heitman: Mike Perry and Tamara Mura, and pulling content from courses that we already have.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Tom Heitman: and repackaging those. And so that's kind of, in this particular case with LiveView.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Tom Heitman: there was, I think it was, like, a strategic leadership course or something that they wanted to use, and so Jason pulled that.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Tom Heitman: And kind of pulled out some highlights and ran it by Tamara and Mike and said, is this kind of what you're looking for? They're like, yeah, I use these units. So he just repackaged those, spruced them up.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Tom Heitman: added some different images, um, and put that in Blackboard in a… I think it's…

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Tom Heitman: I don't know if it's 8 units, I think it's 3 or 4 units, um, but I think this one's 20 to 30 hours. It's got a little assessment at the end. Like I said, it'll run through continuing education.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Tom Heitman: We run it through the editor, we run it through the tech, and off it goes.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Eric Severson: So, let me describe…

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, that's… that's perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for, and…

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Eric Severson: I will… let me describe…

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Eric Severson: two projects that we've got going, and when I say projects, they're, uh…

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Eric Severson: Potential partnerships.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Tom Heitman: Uh-huh.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Eric Severson: And I'd love to make sure that.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Eric Severson: As many of the issues that we can put upstream.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and I'll… and I'll… your checklist that doesn't exist would be something, and I would definitely love to know the top.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Eric Severson: 5 or 6 things that we can think about and introduce, especially with customers.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm, mhm.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Eric Severson: That are maybe not used to educational delivery, so…

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Eric Severson: We've got this very… I think this is an enormously cool opportunity. Uh, Tony found this through Sigma Mutual and through one of their partners.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Eric Severson: a company called CTR. CTR is a staffing company, uh, that…

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Eric Severson: realize that's working with the shipbuilding industry and some of the aerospace manufacturers in Alabama.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Eric Severson: They realized the demand for workers, for labor, was so far out of their ability to find local talent, or even relocating talent.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Eric Severson: That the staffing firm hired a subject matter expert will just.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Eric Severson: Pick the first example, welding, which is a big deal in the shipbuilding industry, right?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Eric Severson: They found a welder, the welder put together a 75-page PDF.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Eric Severson: And the staffing firm also is a recruiting firm, right? So they recruit and they staff for temp.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Eric Severson: They they recruit.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Eric Severson: people with aptitude, but not the skills. They put them through, uh, I think it's a 10-week process right now.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Eric Severson: that is in person with Larry the Welder delivering, uh, some kind of classroom experience with a PDF, right?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Eric Severson: And then at the end of that, this particular company places their graduates with.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Eric Severson: the shipbuilders who have… one of them has, like, an outstanding rack for welders of 150, right? So they're not… there's this crazy imbalance between demand and supply.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Eric Severson: And with all the stuff going on with the Golden Fleet, the maritime, you know, stuff, the demand for labor is just going to go up like that.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Eric Severson: They came to us, or through Signal Mutual, and they said, look.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Eric Severson: we don't really know what we're doing. We don't really view ourselves as an educational delivery.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Eric Severson: group. We'd like to partner with you guys. We'd like to figure out how to take not just this program, but a bunch of these skills, uh, and, and.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Eric Severson: trades preparation. We'd like you guys to be able to be our partner for instructional delivery.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Eric Severson: And then, because it's welding, there may be 6 weeks of online stuff followed by 4 weeks of in-person, let's practice and skill and validate that you actually have the skills, right?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Tom Heitman: Yep.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and so, what's interesting to me about this is two things. One, it feels like we're not… we don't have a lot of this in the CSU.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Eric Severson: process, meaning we're certainly not… I don't see a lot of revenue generation from this kind of thing.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Eric Severson: And so it's new revenue generation. I don't think it's a killer amount of revenue, because it's a 6-week non-degree program.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Eric Severson: But it, nonetheless, it's revenue generation, and maybe more importantly, it allows me and Tony to change the dialogue or the conversation with.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Eric Severson: learning partners from, you know, the current conversation is about stackable credentials for sure, but retention, degree program, promotion, all that stuff. Now we can bring that all the way to the front.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Eric Severson: and say, you know, let us help you with your workforce solutions. Let us help you with your very basic needs, especially in these skilled trade environments.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Eric Severson: We'll, uh, we've got a partner, we'll do the recruiting, we'll put them through university, you know, qualified online training.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and at the end of that, they've got physical training, and then they go into, you know, the job.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Eric Severson: If CSU is part of that from the very beginning, that changes how the employers think about us, number one, and number two, both the employers and that cohort of.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Eric Severson: I call it labor to leader. That cohort of welders is going to think about, well, if I like this, and I'm sticking with Engels for 3 or 4 years.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Eric Severson: and Ingalls is adding 150 welders every quarter, you know, there's gonna need to be some supervisors, there's gonna need to be some managers, and that's when.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Eric Severson: they… then… then we think they'll come back and think about CSU.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Tom Heitman: Comes full circle, yeah. That makes sense.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Eric Severson: Yeah. So, we haven't met with Misty yet, we'll be meeting with her shortly, but I just was curious, today we had a yet but another conversation with this.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Eric Severson: partner, recruiting staffing partner. And I was… and they're very excited about, uh, the potential to work with us.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Eric Severson: And we were getting down into things like, do you want… what's the structure of the course that you want to do? Is it a cohort?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Eric Severson: Uh, so that we can follow through. How much have you thought about quizzes and grading, and how you want to measure that yet? Do you have those rubrics?

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Eric Severson: It's Larry, the welder, sitting in a room for, you know, 10 weeks with a bunch of other guys trying to be welders in a PDF.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Eric Severson: So they don't have the educational background, haven't thought about all of these things, which got me… which I realized, oh boy, they don't know, and at this stage, I figured it would be.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Eric Severson: something that would get worked out later, but in the interest of educating prospects, I did want to sort of.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Eric Severson: Think about and hear from you about how… what are those key questions.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Eric Severson: In a situation like this, that we would be well served to ask the upfront and at least get them thinking about.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Eric Severson: Uh, those things. And then from your perspective, so it's a PDF, they definitely want to know if we can.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Eric Severson: improve the safety content, and it's welding, so I'm sure we don't have a, you know, a series of welding, uh, I'm assuming we don't have welding content anymore, but we certainly have safety content.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Tom Heitman: Right. Right.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Tom Heitman: Yes.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Eric Severson: And so, how would something like that work if it, if it came into you? Is it just like LVT?

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, yeah, I mean, more or less, like, we're doing something similar to what you're… we've done this in the past with people.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, we're working on another… are you… are you guys familiar with the Green Training Services project?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Tom Heitman: You know about that one? Okay, so… this one came through Dana.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Eric Severson: I do not.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Tony Atchley: No.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Tom Heitman: strategic academic partnerships? I don't know, I can't keep all you guys straight, I don't know who does what, but…

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Tom Heitman: But she came to me and said, hey, look, there's this company out in Las Vegas.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Tom Heitman: they're CSU graduates, they… they fly people out, they put them on site for, like you said, 10 weeks, or whatever it is.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Tom Heitman: And their whole purpose is safety and construction equipment.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Tom Heitman: Like, they talk about the different types of equipment, they talk about how to use it safely, they talk about.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Tom Heitman: What it all is, and how it works, and why this could happen, and why that could happen, and why it's important to use these.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Tom Heitman: Certifications to make sure you're doing it right, all the things, and they're like.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Tom Heitman: We've hit a ceiling because the in person, you can only go so far.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Tom Heitman: And so they were like, there are aspects of this that we could put online.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Tom Heitman: Um, there are aspects of this that we could keep, you know, on-site, or we could have some kind of hybrid, you know, what do you guys think?

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Tom Heitman: And, um, that's where, again, we got in a room with their…

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Tom Heitman: owners, and they're, uh, like you said, kind of Larry the Welder, but just in a different.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Tom Heitman: space, um, and then some of our instructional designers, Misty was on the call, some of the safety people were on the call.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Tom Heitman: And we just had a conversation, and they said, look, this is what we're looking for.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Tom Heitman: And then we started asking some of the high-level questions about, well, how many weeks do you want it to be? Do you want it fully online?

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Tom Heitman: Um, like I said earlier, is this just your branding, or is it CSUs? Is it a partnership?

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Tom Heitman: What's the timeline for this? You know, when are you looking? Everybody's timeline is yesterday.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Tom Heitman: But… when you have a bunch of these projects, it can't be yesterday, so what's reasonable based on.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Tom Heitman: on this, um, you know, where is… what kind of demographic do you have? I mean, do these people have access to…

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Tom Heitman: computers that can do some of these things, you know, you still have to think about some of that, and it's mainly for…

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Tom Heitman: firewalls and things like that, um, because if you send them elsewhere, sometimes you can't all… you know, they have to get permission to go to those sites and things like that. So, um…

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Tom Heitman: And then Misty comes in, well, what does this partnership look like? What's the revenue share? How much are we gonna charge for this? How often are we gonna…

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Tom Heitman: offer it, you know, those types of things, um, and then an MOU comes together, and usually.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Tom Heitman: We get answers to those questions. Who are the key people that we are going to work with? Who are your point of contacts? Who is Larry the Welder?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Tom Heitman: Are there other people? You know, that kind of stuff. Are there certificates that you want attached to this? How do we deliver those? Who signs off on those? Um, that's another thing we're…

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Eric Severson: Yep.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Tom Heitman: working on a wildland fire thing, and it's actually the wildland fire concentration, Tony, you know all about that, but like, you know, there's… when they get done with it, there's the, I don't know, SR90 and SR60 and whatever your check marks are for this and that, and the next thing, and.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Tony Atchley: Yep.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Tom Heitman: That's just part of the course. Is any of that going to be involved? And if so.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Tom Heitman: Do you distribute that? Does continuing education at CSU distribute that? Does some outside entity distribute that that we have a partnership with?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Tom Heitman: So, questions like that, I can write some of these down and send them to you, but I'm just kind of giving you an example of some of the things that.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Tom Heitman: Depending on what the industry is, those are some of the questions that we ask.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Tom Heitman: Up front, so that at least then we have a framework to go back and say.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Tom Heitman: All right, IDT, alright, subject matter experts at CSU, alright, Misty Academic Administration, alright, continuing education.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Tom Heitman: This is what we're working with. How do we want to outline this? How does this timeline work?

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Tom Heitman: you know, can we put this in Blackboard? Like, all those different…

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Tom Heitman: A lot of it, too, is how complicated, or not complicated, but…

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Tom Heitman: how many bells and whistles do you want? Because that impacts the development time, that impacts the resources that we have, that impacts the cost.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Tom Heitman: You know, if you want an avatar that's talking back and forth to you, that's gonna cost more than…

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Tom Heitman: you know, creating some modules out of that PDF with nice pictures and videos and things. I mean, we could do that real easily, but, you know, once you start getting into.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Tom Heitman: Okay, like, for instance, nursing has Willow Labs. Have you guys ever seen the Willow Labs?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Eric Severson: Yes. It's super cool, yeah.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Tom Heitman: I mean, it's kind of, it's really cool, you know, you've got your patient sitting in front of you, you take their heartbeat, you ask them the questions, they, they talk back to you, like.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Tom Heitman: It's not cheap, though, you know? I mean, those things are expensive, so you kind of have to talk through the resources and what.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Tom Heitman: Either they're willing to spend, or what we think the students taking this are.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Tom Heitman: Whoever is taking this, clients are willing to spend on this.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Tom Heitman: So… I don't know, does that help at all, what I'm saying?

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Eric Severson: Well, this is perfect, Tom. This is exactly…

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah. Do you… do you ever look at doing, uh, like, a crawl, walk, run, a phased approach, where, you know, you've got, uh, phase one, maybe phase two comes in with a.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Tom Heitman: Okay.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Tony Atchley: You know, a higher degree of complexity as far as the design work.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, aspect of it. Uh, have you done that sort of thing where there's built-in revisits?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Tony Atchley: that you know are gonna come. Just curious.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Tom Heitman: Not specifically, like you're explaining it, but I feel like, A, that's a good idea, and B.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Tom Heitman: I mean, sometimes it just organically goes that way, where you get started, and then they're like, nah, this isn't quite what we're looking for, can we do this?

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Tom Heitman: Sure. Or, no, let's shift, but we can do this, you know, um…

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Tom Heitman: Kind of a deal, uh…

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Tom Heitman: No, we haven't really taken that approach. But, I will also say.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Tom Heitman: I'd say we have all these projects and everything, but it's probably just in the past 3 years where all of this has really started to ramp up.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Tom Heitman: Um, really, that ODP was the first big…

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Tom Heitman: Course, or series of courses, because it ended up being 18 courses.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Tom Heitman: where we kind of had that full team together, and I mean, I think that was 2023 and 2024, so, I mean, we're…

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Tom Heitman: We're not… we're still babies when it comes to these special project type things.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Tom Heitman: But I feel like, in those 3 years, we've come up with a pretty good system, it's just, there's gonna be scenarios like you're talking about that we just haven't done yet. Doesn't mean we can't.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Tom Heitman: It's just, nobody's ever brought it forward in that way, so…

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Tom Heitman: I like to say we're quick learners, but…

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Tom Heitman: You know, we all say that, right?

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Eric Severson: Um…

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Eric Severson: And in that officer development thing, are those…

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Eric Severson: cohort-based, or they… CE is often… no, they're not cohort-based.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Tom Heitman: No, no, they are, they are. Like, so…

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Eric Severson: They are. Oh, great. Terrific.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Tom Heitman: A certain amount of people sign up for it, they all go into that section, and they all go through it together, and they all have that same.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Eric Severson: Okay, fantastic.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Tom Heitman: I think… I can't remember if there's a… I think there's a… like, a professor that oversees it, but I can't remember, but yeah, those are all…

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Tom Heitman: Cohort base that started this time, it's this group of people, and we push them through, yeah.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Eric Severson: Cool. This has been enormously helpful. I mean, again, we're very excited about this…

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Eric Severson: entry point for CSU at the pre-employment phase as a way to, A, collect that new revenue.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Eric Severson: Establish a different relationship with all of our potential learning partners, and uh… and then also seed.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Eric Severson: you know, the downstream degree seekers. So, it was just important for me to hear, are these things possible? How might we…

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Eric Severson: you know, what else do I need to think about as we're talking with our potential partners about this?

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Tom Heitman: I think this is great, and I think it…

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Tom Heitman: It's good that you guys are bringing this forward so that we can… because right now, yeah, we do these things.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Tom Heitman: But it's not like an off-the-shelf process, and I think it could be. Like, I do. I really think it could be. You're asking me, well, how does this typically… well, it's a little bit different every time.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Tom Heitman: And it's always gonna be a little bit different every time, but it's not like, alright, let's pull that book off the shelf and open up the pages. It's like… and it probably should be. I think that's where we're going. I think as we expand.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Tom Heitman: You know, you're gonna get more of these opportunities that come forward, and it's like, we almost need… it's kind of turned into that way, where we just have a separate set of people that just work on these types of projects.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Tom Heitman: Um, so that when you guys come in and say, hey, there's this opportunity, they've got this PDF, and Larry the Welder leading this program, but they want to put a part of it online, or a part of it.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Tom Heitman: You know, alright, great, here it is, this is the group you're gonna be working with, this is when we can get it done.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Tom Heitman: Go back, see if that's okay, back and forth, off we go. And you know exactly.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Tom Heitman: what you're getting, and you know what the process is. So, I mean, I would support that.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Tom Heitman: For sure. I mean, we can do that now, I'm just saying, I think…

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Tom Heitman: Aside from Larry the Welder, it's like, it's good to kind of start to really put this.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Tom Heitman: Process in place.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, Tony and I have been kicking around the concept of productizing this offer so that as we go out, we've got, you know, pamphlets, flyers, a formal way of addressing.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Tony Atchley: Great.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Eric Severson: Our capabilities around this.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Eric Severson: It sounds like… who would I touch base with to hear the story of green? What's the rest of it, Green?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Tom Heitman: Green training services.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Eric Severson: grain training services, because it sounds like that is extremely similar to what we're talking about with CTR.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Eric Severson: And we have another company that is a recruiting company that, out of necessity.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Eric Severson: Did this basic skills training for.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Eric Severson: Vertiv, which is an HVAC, commercial HVAC company, and for Comfort Systems, which is a field.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Eric Severson: field technician job. And they… again, back to the same problem, they couldn't find enough qualified candidates, and so…

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Eric Severson: they bootstrapped this, and they've reached that same point where they're like, ah, I don't know that we want to do this. We'd like to find a real educational partner to deliver this stuff.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and it's in that same vein, it would could, it isn't a credential like a.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Eric Severson: even maybe a certificate, but it's not… certainly not a degree. It's, you know, 10 to 12 weeks of training, you go to work.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Tom Heitman: Yep.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Eric Severson: Uh, on these guys.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, and, and…

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Tom Heitman: I think I would talk to Misty. I mean, Misty's the one that oversees, really, all of these things, so if you are talking to her later today or tomorrow, whenever it is, like, definitely…

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Eric Severson: All that. Okay.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Tom Heitman: run that by her, because… I mean, it really is kind of what you're talking about. They came to us.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Tom Heitman: Hey, we do it this way, we'd like to do it that way, so we can scale it, offer it a different way.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Tom Heitman: Um, we know that you guys have the education thing down, you know, we're… we're…

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Tom Heitman: you know, graduates, we like your product, whatever. Um, here's what we have. And that's what they did. They gave us PowerPoints. They had…

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Tom Heitman: a series of PowerPoints that… this is what we use, and this is how we go through it, and it even had, you know, okay, time for a break, everybody go to the bathroom for 5 minutes, so, you know, you gotta take that slide out, you gotta…

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Tom Heitman: And the slides are real busy, because they're in there talking about them, and it's like, okay, that's not exactly…

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Tom Heitman: really, I mean, this doesn't work for online. We need to revamp this and package it a different way. And so that's, like, what we've been doing, working with them.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Tom Heitman: Um, and…

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Tom Heitman: The biggest issue we run into, and I will tell you this, probably the most important question out of all of them that you ever ask these people that have content already.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Tom Heitman: If it's from scratch, it's a different ballgame. But if they have the PDF, or they have the PowerPoints.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Tom Heitman: where did you get that content, and do you actually have permission to use it, or did you just go to Google.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Tom Heitman: And type in, give me an image for fire extinguisher, and pull that and put it in, because we can't use that.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Eric Severson: What about, uh… this is off-topic, but back to my… I am obsessed with AI, absolutely obsessed.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Tom Heitman: Sure.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Eric Severson: Uh, are you… how do you think about image… image creation, AI images for use in… in… in our content?

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Tom Heitman: I mean, we use them all the time. We just cite them… we cite them a certain way, and…

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Eric Severson: You're doing that now, and…

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Tom Heitman: just let everybody know, hey, this is AI generated, we're careful with it. We don't use it for everything.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Tom Heitman: Um, for instance, I created a image… well, actually, no, uh, what was it? It was in Synthesia, they don't do it anymore, but…

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Tom Heitman: you could take a picture of yourself from 5 different angles, and then you create an avatar, then you… in AI, you say, make Tom a firefighter fighting a fire in front of a, you know, single-dwelling house with blah blah blah blah blah.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Tom Heitman: And so it did, and I was like, Keith, this is awesome, we should use this in a course. He's like, nah, man, you have a beard. Firefighters don't have beards, you can't use that. Everybody's… it's gonna be discredited.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Tom Heitman: And he's like, you see that shield that's on that helmet? That's all wrong, and this and that, and I was like, you know.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Tom Heitman: Burst my bubble, but, you know, Keith and I are real good friends, so it's aha. But, you know, we are careful with what we use it for.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Tom Heitman: Um, so that we make sure that it's accurate, uh, but, I mean, we use it.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Tom Heitman: All the time, for simple things, and, you know.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Tom Heitman: you're obsessed with AI, eventually you can get the prompt right to where it…

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Tom Heitman: We'll give you what you're looking for, but uh…

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Tom Heitman: I mean…

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Eric Severson: I've tied myself in some knots all the way down the JSON prompting rat hole for nano banana.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Eric Severson: Because, again, you can get so close, but there's always one or two things in there. Before here, I worked at Universal Technical Institute, which is a big trade school, 16 campuses around the country, and.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Tom Heitman: Always.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Eric Severson: One of the things that, uh, I was the head of all admissions, and one of the things we're constantly struggling with is.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Eric Severson: Our marketers would put together image… stock imagery of.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Eric Severson: stuff, and they would never run it by the academics, and there, if you are putting a Kawasaki and a Harley-Davidson ad.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, yeah.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Eric Severson: that is not gonna work, right? Or you're talking about the wrong engine dynamics.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Tom Heitman: No. Yeah, exactly.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Eric Severson: With the wrong image, everybody's gonna go, these guys are jokers, they don't know what they're talking about.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Tom Heitman: Right. Right.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Eric Severson: So, AI's still got that little wrinkle to it as well.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, I'll just… yeah, we use it with caution, that's what I'll say, but I mean, we do.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Tom Heitman: use it. I mean, we use it in psychology courses, you know, show me an image of this guy talking to this girl about this thing, you know, like…

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Tom Heitman: And just simple things like that, but, um, you're right.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Eric Severson: I have a couple of… a couple of friends that are running these edtech content companies now.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Tom Heitman: Into technical things.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Eric Severson: And one of them in particular calls me up, and we compare notes on… he's a videographer, and I'm curious about it, but he…

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Eric Severson: I think at some point, the animation world, we used to… at Pearson, we used to pay boo-coo bucks for custom animations.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Eric Severson: man, that feels like it's not here yet, but boy, cutaways, even at UTI, we would spend.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Eric Severson: a phenomenal amount of money to get a car, cut it in half, and make it a teaching aid as a teaching aid pretty soon.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Eric Severson: You know, you give it the technical direction, the technical specifications, and it feels like that stuff's got some pretty wild.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Eric Severson: Potential to it, at just dramatically lower cost.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, and where we've seen a lot of success, or… I don't know, it's still too early to tell. I say success, because I think it's cool, but like…

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Tom Heitman: We're using a lot of AI videos to introduce concepts, so, like, it'll be a 30-second.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Tom Heitman: pieced together clip that I created in Sora of… for criminal justice, where.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Tom Heitman: It starts off with a burglar breaking into a car.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Tom Heitman: And then it cuts to, you know, that's a 10-second scene. And then it cuts to, uh, two guys in a suit walking in that particular area, talking about what happened.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Tom Heitman: That's a 10-second scene. And then they're back at the police station or whatever, and they're talking about the evidence that they found on the scene, and how it could link…

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Tom Heitman: And then at the end, you know, we'll throw something funny in there, like Batman comes… or Superhero comes in and captures the thief and gets… but it's just a little 30-second, kind of almost, like, icebreaker…

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Tom Heitman: But it sets the scene, and then you go into, you know, forensics and, you know, what's important, and how you would actually go through the scene, and what you're looking for, and that kind of stuff, but it just… it introduces that topic in a way that, like you were saying, would cost.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Tom Heitman: tons of money to do, and now I can do it in 30 minutes. You know, I create 4 clips.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Tom Heitman: throw them in, uh, Clipchamp, add some different…

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Tom Heitman: you know, transitions to it, export it, and I'm done. And it can go right in the course. And…

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Tom Heitman: Cost me 20 bucks a month, you know, like…

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Eric Severson: That is… that is super cool. Super cool. I…

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Tony Atchley: So… so, Tom, hold that thought, because you're going to have that exact application to apply to some of the coursework that's coming from LVT.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah. Okay.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Tony Atchley: Or that's gonna be needed there, yeah.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Tom Heitman: But those are the things we're experimenting with, those are the things that we're doing now, those are the things that we're starting to figure out how to put into courses, and it's just.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Tom Heitman: it snowballs, because, you know, you think of that, oh, we're using it for that, well, how could we use it for this? You know, and that's… and we can rely on you guys to help with that, too. It's like…

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Tom Heitman: this is what they're looking for, can you do that, or something similar to it, you know? So…

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Tom Heitman: We're all in for innovation. Um, I can't tell you we can do everything, but we're gonna try, you know?

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Eric Severson: Good.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Eric Severson: You know, I think there are a couple of things that, uh, that CSU has opportunities to be more aggressive about in their promotion.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:02.000
Eric Severson: And I'm thinking about promotion from a B2B business-to-business perspective to future learning partners, but now, you know, there's high interest in.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Eric Severson: how are you using AI in general, but specifically to enhance the student experience. So I love that you're talking to us about this. I would love to find a way to stay on top of it. It's high interest.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Eric Severson: For our learning partners, right, to hear about these things, and…

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Eric Severson: I don't think, you know, the other one is affordability. I think, you know, CSU is the biggest school nobody's ever heard of, and when they do hear about it, the things that are in their head are.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Tom Heitman: Right.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Eric Severson: they're good things, but there aren't affordability. The affordability message isn't at the top.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Eric Severson: And I think there's a… just listening to this, there's a much better story that could be told about the student experience, especially in this moment in time.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Eric Severson: There's so much stuff changing, uh, to know that there is an investment, and there is some innovation and some experimentation going on.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm, mhm.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Eric Severson: Uh, helps us bring that story to future learning partners.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, and I've been urged to get that out in front of the university a little bit more.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Tom Heitman: Just in general, you know, like, show them that you're creative, you know, show some examples of some of these things that you've been doing, and talk about why you did it, and how it can enhance the student experience, and then…

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Tom Heitman: Because, you know, you're talking to the whole institution. You guys might…

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Tom Heitman: See that, and come up with ideas, and be like, oh yeah, we should go tell our learning partners about this, and…

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Tom Heitman: You know? So, I mean…

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Tom Heitman: I think you'll start to see that from us here pretty soon, um…

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Tom Heitman: you know, we're just busy. I mean, it's just hard to ever stop and do those things, you know?

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, everybody needs a marketer.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Tom Heitman: Um… yeah, exactly. Uh, we just need a…

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Tom Heitman: Smiling face to go out and show these things and do the legwork, but I count my blessings every day. Most schools don't have a team of 35 people that do this kind of stuff.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Tom Heitman: So I don't take it for granted either, and so I try to be innovative and push the limits and be like, oh, this is what we're doing.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Tom Heitman: This is what you're paying these salaries for, and hopefully we can stay ahead of the curve and.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Tom Heitman: you know, get some of these learning partners on board, and show them that we have these resources, and can put together products that they like, so they keep coming back. I mean, we did one for FBI LIDA.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Tom Heitman: um, wasn't as in-depth, but it was… it was literally just kind of putting together some PowerPoint presentations, um, and using.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Tom Heitman: iSpring and Captivate to put those… they loved it, and they keep coming back for more. I mean, we're on the third phase of their development, so you're right, the opportunities are out there, and if you can show them a good product and show them that you're continuing to look.

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Tom Heitman: In the future, they'll keep coming back, so that's… and that's what we want to do, so…

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Eric Severson: So we'll definitely talk with Misty about.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Tom Heitman: you know.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Eric Severson: productizing this category, because I didn't even know about green training services, but that seems like…

00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Eric Severson: It seems like a, uh, an offering that if we're comfortable with, you know, I've been here less than 6 months, and we've got 2 really significant.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Eric Severson: partnership opportunities with different companies on exactly this model. And it sounds like green sort of organically happened. I've got to imagine that there are many others out there right now.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Eric Severson: Where, you know, it may be an unusual, it's not the Fortune 500 necessarily, but they're doing… especially because it gives us this connection to.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Eric Severson: employment, right? And it almost… it almost skips the academic.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Tom Heitman: Yep.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Eric Severson: Connection, so it's training to employment with an promise of an academic partnership down the road if you need it.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah. It… and that's something I think about all the time, too, because…

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Eric Severson: That's pretty cool.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Tom Heitman: academics truly is different than training. Um, you know, there are two sides… well, there's multiple sides to instructional design, but, like.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Tom Heitman: At CSU, sometimes it is hard, it's not hard, it's just, you just have to get in that mindset, it's like.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Tom Heitman: You're not talking to a traditional student that's taking a course for credit. You're talking to someone that's just trying to learn a skill.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Tom Heitman: To do better, you know? Like, and…

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Tom Heitman: That's important to keep in mind as we have these conversations, but that's why I think some of these instructional designers that I have are really valuable, because some of them come from the business world, and they did training, and that's what they did.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Tom Heitman: we've got a nice mixture of, you know, we've got school teachers, we've got people that worked at Regions Bank, we've got people that, you know.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Tom Heitman: all kinds of different backgrounds for those different perspectives, you kind of pull them in and say, hey, remember when you worked at American Express?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Tom Heitman: How did this work? Kind of a deal.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Tom Heitman: Um, so…

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Tony Atchley: Selfishly, do our degree programs produce the, uh, you know, potential students for you down the road?

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Tom Heitman: I hope so. Um…

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. I mean, I mean, I'm talking about the… the IDT stuff that we…

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Tom Heitman: Oh, like our IDT programs?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, again, I hope so. I think it's still too young to know. Uh, the courses that we put together, I feel, should prepare students.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Tom Heitman: for that, um…

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Tom Heitman: There's some…

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Tom Heitman: Obstacles we need to get over, I'll just leave it at that, but, um…

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, I think that…

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Tom Heitman: I'd like to see us expand some of our offerings to include more of the.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Tom Heitman: future, if you will, which I know is hard to capture, because it changes, but, like.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Tom Heitman: I mean, the technology side of instructional design is blowing up, as you know, with all this AI stuff.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Tom Heitman: And with, even with the labs and the different learning resources that the publishers come to us with, I mean, that whole industry is transforming.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Tom Heitman: Um, and I understand that there's a lot of theory behind instructional design. I think that's sometimes a stumbling block at academic institutions, is they want to.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Tom Heitman: You know, focus so much on adult learning theory and all these other things, it's like…

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, but you're not sitting there at 2 o'clock in the morning thinking, well, which theory would make the most sense to use when I'm, you know, it's…

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Tom Heitman: what tool am I gonna use? How am I gonna deliver this? What's the target audience? Like…

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Tom Heitman: So…

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, I do. I mean, I have confidence in it. I think we just need to continue to grow it and evolve it.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Tom Heitman: Uh, but… yeah, I hope so. Um, so…

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Tony Atchley: Cool.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Tom Heitman: And there's just… it's so weird, like, I was at dinner with a group of friends the other night, and.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Tom Heitman: This, um…

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Tom Heitman: One of the ladies that we're friends with, she works at a company, Pure Car, or something like that.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Tom Heitman: They do something in the automotive industry, and she's like, I got this new promotion, and it's like, my boss told me that I need to get a certificate in instructional design, because I'm going to be doing training and things. Well, guess what?

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Tom Heitman: you're in luck. So…

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Eric Severson: I happen to know somebody. Me.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, and so, it's just… it's little things like that, and I think what I was gonna say as you guys were talking about all this, is like.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, we've got green training, got FBLA, but I, I truly believe it only takes one.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Tom Heitman: That sets it all off, and then word of mouth, it's like, wow, they really did this, and they tell this company, and then they want it, and then they want it, and then they want it, and then they want it.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Tom Heitman: And, um, I just… I really think if we keep down this path.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Tom Heitman: one or two of these is really gonna hit, and it may not seem like a big… like you were saying, it may not be the Fortune 500 company, but it might be…

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Tom Heitman: The pure car company that's, oh, wow, look at this, and then they want it, and they want it, and they want it, and then we have a bad problem, is…

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Tom Heitman: We have too much work, and we can't do it all, but… yeah. But, yeah.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Eric Severson: Gotta hire more people, right? Or… or find more AI, one of the two.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. Well…

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, exactly.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, the whole… the whole LVT relationship is just that. It's… it's them, but it's… it's more the extension into their customer base.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Tony Atchley: that is the big carrot for us, and where we'll be able to go with this, if they're using the curriculum that we're developing on the recommendation of LVT.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Tom Heitman: Yep.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Tony Atchley: then, uh, we're inserted into the Home Depots, into the Advance Autos, into the, you know, uh, into all the big retail, you know, that's out there in a criminal justice type.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, yeah. Okay.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Tony Atchley: Um, you know, assisting kind of mode with the technology that they're using, so…

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah. I love it.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Eric Severson: If I wanted to learn more about how the green training services thing got started, who do you think I should follow up with just to say.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Eric Severson: You know, is there a prospectus? Show me the MOU. It sounds like we're doing something very similar.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Tom Heitman: I mean, I'm telling you, Misty. Misty's gonna be the one that's gonna point you to it. I know I keep saying her name, but, like.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Eric Severson: Um…

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Eric Severson: Misty, okay, alright.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Tom Heitman: Dana and Misty… Dana Fuller and Misty are the two that…

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Eric Severson: do this stuff.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Tom Heitman: did that whole thing. And really, I'm only telling you that, too, because I don't… I don't know all the contract side and how it all came about. I mean, I know that…

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Tom Heitman: I don't exactly know how they even came in contact with them, but I do know that they were graduates. I do know that.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Tom Heitman: You know, the main issue they were having is they kind of have this on-site thing, and they wanted to.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Tom Heitman: Pull it online, um…

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Tom Heitman: But as far as, like, the MOU and how it all came about, I mean, Misty… Misty runs all that. She's the one that worked the deal, and…

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Tom Heitman: Went back and forth with them and everything, so…

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Eric Severson: Okay.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Eric Severson: And then…

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Tom Heitman: She's probably gonna be able to help you the most.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Eric Severson: Tom, on things like, uh, metadata management.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Eric Severson: Accessibility, compliance, alignments and classifications, is that all part of IDT?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Tom Heitman: That's a very good question. Um…

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Tom Heitman: Yes and no? Um…

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, I guess.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Tom Heitman: It it…

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Eric Severson: How does that work get done today? Are there tools that CSU uses for that, or is it all people?

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Tom Heitman: It's really…

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Tom Heitman: Depends on… I don't know, you named off a…

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Eric Severson: A bunch of stuff, right?

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Tom Heitman: 3 different areas, you know? Um…

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Tom Heitman: Accessibility, for instance.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, that all falls on us. It just… it just does. I know there's an ADA compliance, um…

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Tom Heitman: Committee that meets occasionally, but when it comes to…

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Tom Heitman: ADA compliance, accessibility…

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Tom Heitman: I mean, it's… it's… it's… we work with…

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Tom Heitman: Jennifer Lee Hooper in the compliance office, and she kind of keeps us up to date on anything that's coming down from.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Tom Heitman: You know, federal government or whatever, but it's really up to us to do the research, to…

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Tom Heitman: work with Blackboard to run the different reports. We use Blackboard Ally, it tells us if things are accessible.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Tom Heitman: Um, we've got a couple of guys on our team that they're kind of dubbed ADA compliance people.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Tom Heitman: That type of thing. As far as…

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Tom Heitman: Pulling the…

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Tom Heitman: I don't know, would one of them be kind of pulling the data for effectiveness within the courses, and kind of how that all works?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Tom Heitman: Um…

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Tom Heitman: That's a conversation for drinks after work, but, um…

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Eric Severson: Is it all manual? Is it all people? Okay.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Tom Heitman: Pretty much. It's pretty much all manual, and it shouldn't be…

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Tom Heitman: But it is, um, and I have my thoughts on that, but again, I could go off on a tangent for 30 minutes.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Tom Heitman: Um…

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Tom Heitman: We're trying to shift some things to where we have a centralized system.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Tom Heitman: that will give us more effective data, as opposed to working everything through Omega.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Tom Heitman: And manually creating reports out of spreadsheets and things like that.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Eric Severson: Aha.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Tom Heitman: Um, we haven't…

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Tom Heitman: A found the right tool just yet.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Tom Heitman: And it's just hard to get any kind of buy-in because Omega is such the precious baby at CSU.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Eric Severson: No, no, I got… I didn't think about Omega. I sort of assumed that course content would have to live outside of that, uh, almost entirely, but probably.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Tom Heitman: It does, but the spider web of how all that stuff is connected.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Eric Severson: I didn't remember that.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Eric Severson: Yeah.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Tom Heitman: is mind-blowing. I mean, the way that all of our APIs and integrations work.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Tom Heitman: and how they have to be set up such a certain way is part of the reason I have such a big tech team.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Tom Heitman: It's because if every single assignment in Blackboard and every single rubric in Blackboard is pushed into Omega.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Tom Heitman: And then the reports that Academics runs for Sax Narratives or iPads or whatever.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Tom Heitman: all comes out of Omega, but what that means for me is I'm doing double the work, because I have to set it up in Blackboard, and I have to set it up in Omega, because there's nothing that…

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Tom Heitman: talks to each other to automate that process. And so, when I build a rubric for an assignment as a direct measure in Blackboard.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Tom Heitman: that needs to be measured up to a program learning outcome to go to Sachs to say that we're doing this the correct way, I have to do all that in two different places.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Tom Heitman: And it's just… there's… that's just one example about data and how we get it, but…

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Tom Heitman: it's just… it's kind of a messy process at this point. I'm not talking bad about anybody, and I don't think it's… it's just the way we've done it, you know what I mean? Like…

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Eric Severson: No, no, totally. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Tom Heitman: It just kind of is what it is, um…

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Eric Severson: Well, the reason I was curious about that is, uh, I have a good friend, again, I have 30 years at Pearson, and so a lot of my former colleagues.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Eric Severson: uh, went out and are still in the industry doing different things. I have a good friend that founded a company called Syllabite AI, and it is, uh, being used now by Vista Higher Ed, the learning company.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Eric Severson: edX is using it, and it does metadata management, alignments and classifications, accessibility compliance, RAG pipeline, and.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Eric Severson: content delivery, and even content generation, and it's heavily API-based.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Tom Heitman: Okay.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Eric Severson: So, if there ever is a point where you're… I'll send you the link to Syllabite AI, and if there's anything remotely interesting there.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Eric Severson: Uh, the guy's business is exploding, largely because most of the publishers have been cutting back on staff like crazy.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Eric Severson: And so their ability to manage the content, even simple things like the alt tags, they get, you know, they got people running around with little hammers hammering away on the alt tags all over the place.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Tom Heitman: Yep.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Tom Heitman: Yep.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Eric Severson: And for, you know, at least at Pearson, ADA and EAA was a big deal, right? They wanted to make sure that they were.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Eric Severson: Not getting sideways with somebody on that stuff. So, his business is exploding and, and uh… you know.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Eric Severson: He's enabling a lot of that stuff, and if it's ever of any interest, I'd be delighted to set up a call, no pressure, and…

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah. I…

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Eric Severson: That's why I was curious.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Tom Heitman: I'd like to definitely keep that contact open.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Tom Heitman: Um…

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, send me some information on that.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Eric Severson: Yeah, you never know, right? You absolutely never know where, oh, look at that, I had no idea that that would be done. And again, he's an industry insider, he worked in production, uh, in.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Eric Severson: both McGraw and at, uh, Pearson for a lot of years, and so that's where that all came from.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Tom Heitman: And here's…

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Tom Heitman: One of the biggest stumbling blocks for me…

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Tom Heitman: that I wrestle with every day, is there's all this new AI stuff and automation and whatever.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Tom Heitman: that I don't even know about. It's like, I could have a problem that I don't even know I'm having that AI solves, but I don't know how to even identify that, you know? Without completely unraveling my process.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Tom Heitman: And so, part of one of… and I was just talking about this with Elizabeth this morning, it's like, one of our goals in 2026 is.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Tom Heitman: What's out there that could help us, and how do we identify what that is, you know?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Tom Heitman: Um, and so I feel like companies like that could at least, if you have an initial conversation.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Tom Heitman: You ask each other some questions, you could figure out, oh, I could help you with this.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Tom Heitman: Great! It's what I've been looking for, you know, but I didn't even know that. Or it could be, well, no, you guys are doing this your way, and it's not really for us, but you never know if you don't.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Tom Heitman: So it might be worth at least a conversation, you know?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Eric Severson: I'll send you the info, and if there's any… if you're curious at all, um, I think to that last point, the guy's name is Lucas, uh, he's a great contact to make.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Eric Severson: for exactly that purpose, right? Even if it's not an exact fit, he's in that space doing this sort of work, and would be able to.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Eric Severson: would be delighted to just talk about it, right? There's this going on over here, there's this going on over here, and amen, it's hard to figure out how to stay on top of.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Tom Heitman: Right.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Eric Severson: Not just capabilities, but what's a serious capability versus what's so bleeding edge it's not even worth touching, right?

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Tom Heitman: Right, right, exactly.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Eric Severson: Hard to know that stuff, hard to know that stuff.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Tom Heitman: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Eric Severson: I keep hoping that the CO, the Center of Excellence starts providing some platform or way for us to… I'd just love to know.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Eric Severson: Where across the institution, uh, are interesting things going on?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah. Me too.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Eric Severson: Jason and I worked together at Pearson for a number of years, and I was pushing… there's a company that has a voice agent that you can deploy across the enterprise to collect use cases, and it collects use cases, documents them.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Eric Severson: Puts them all together, and for…

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Eric Severson: An institution of our size, you know, struggling to get a library of use cases.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Tom Heitman: Yep.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Eric Severson: it kind of turns into more of a transformation exercise first, to think about where's our process, how does AI make us think differently about those processes, and what are the ones that are really worth.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Eric Severson: Either a simple automation or a more complex, you know, solution.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Eric Severson: Uh, and there's stuff out there that is, you know, I'm definitely down the road of the voice agents as the next big productivity unlock.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Eric Severson: But, you know, we gotta have meetings. We gotta have meetings so I can evangelize.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Tom Heitman: Gotta have meetings so that you can actually do it, yeah, yeah, I know. I think a lot of people are in that same boat, though. They're waiting to see what comes out of this Diaz team and AI Center of Excellence, and…

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Eric Severson: Right, right.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Tom Heitman: All this talk and everything, and it's like…

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Tom Heitman: Okay, well, we've been doing this for a year and a half now, what do we have to show for it? And, like you said, what are other people doing? And, you know, or what are they asking for, even? What have they accomplished? Or, you know, like…

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Tom Heitman: just kind of having a better idea. I'm with you on that. Um, I think we all get so siloed in our day-to-day operations, it's hard to…

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Tom Heitman: Think about those things sometimes, and that's a horrible excuse, you know?

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Eric Severson: Well, the COE is a good… I'm gonna push Jason for more regular meetings, because the COE is a good boundary-spanning opportunity. That's the one time I at least, was in the company of.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Eric Severson: Non, you know, alumni relations people, or outreach people, or business development people.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, for sure.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Eric Severson: Terrific meeting you, Tom, today. Thank you very much for the time. I know we went a few minutes over, but I really appreciate the time and the connection.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, you too.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Tom Heitman: Okay, yeah. Yeah, I hope this was helpful. I hope it kind of hit on some points that you were looking for, and I didn't just talk the whole time, but yeah, anytime you guys need anything or want to circle back around.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Eric Severson: Super helpful.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Tony Atchley: Super.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Tom Heitman: have ideas, let me know, always happy to meet. Like you did here, just shoot me an invite, and if it…

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Eric Severson: Well, definitely once a quarter, I want to do a quick 30 minutes. What do you got going that we should be representing as new, innovative, exciting for our student body? I think that's…

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Tom Heitman: You know?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Eric Severson: that resonates with potential learning partners, and I really want to be able to tell those stories with enthusiasm as much as possible, so…

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Tom Heitman: Mm-hmm.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Tom Heitman: Yeah, absolutely, for sure, and um…

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Tom Heitman: you know, yeah, anytime you guys need me for something, let me know. Happy to do it. Um, and I'll keep that… I'll keep you guys in mind as we continue to move forward, and…

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Eric Severson: Cool.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Tom Heitman: If there's something big that changes, it's like, hey, these guys probably need to know this, this is another opportunity, or…

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Tom Heitman: At least another something else to put in the tool belt that, when you're talking to them, hey, we do this, too. So, yeah.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Eric Severson: Super cool. Alright, thanks a ton, Tom. Take care.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Tom Heitman: All good. Alright, good to see you guys. Appreciate it. Bye.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Tony Atchley: Perfect. All right. Good seeing you, Tom. Thank you.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Eric Severson: Bye-bye.
