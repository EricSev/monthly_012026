00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Duane Brown: Morning, Tony.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Tony Atchley: Morning.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, your team's really…

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Duane Brown: Knocked it out of the ballpark, didn't they?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Tony Atchley: Who's that?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Duane Brown: Miami and Indiana.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Tony Atchley: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I tried to tell you which way to go on those bets, but you wouldn't listen.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Duane Brown: Well, I don't bet, so…

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, it's all good.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Duane Brown: Man, Indiana just cleaned up Oregon, didn't they?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Tony Atchley: Oh, they're gonna… they're probably gonna clean our clock, too.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Duane Brown: Golly.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, I got a feeling they are.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. I mean…

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Duane Brown: I mean, I know Miami, they're… they're strong, you know, they got a… they got a big line, but…

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Duane Brown: I mean, Indiana's just like… they're like… just like David and Goliath.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Duane Brown: You know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Tony Atchley: Yep.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Tony Atchley: They've… they've gotten more confident, uh, they play, you know, virtually error-free.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Duane Brown: Oh, yeah. Yeah, Mendoza, he's… he's legit, man.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Tony Atchley: Um…

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Duane Brown: He's… he… he… if he doesn't go number one, like, number one, number one.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Tony Atchley: Oh. Yeah.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Duane Brown: There's something wrong with some people.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, it's… I think…

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Duane Brown: Big time.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, and I saw… the one time I saw him play, that was against Penn State, uh, you know, where they had that, um, last minute.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Tony Atchley: You know, uh, end zone touchdown to stay perfect, and… and…

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Tony Atchley: I said then that… I said, they got a legit chance to be all the way, you know, to the final, and…

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Tony Atchley: You know, sure enough, they had… they still had Ohio State at that point, obviously had the playoffs.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Duane Brown: Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, but, man, he's, uh… and, you know, Heisman-wise.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Tony Atchley: Um, he just… he just seemed like the clear-cut…

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Duane Brown: Oh, yeah.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, choice, even at that time, so, uh…

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Tony Atchley: I don't… I don't know. They, um…

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Duane Brown: Oh, yeah.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Tony Atchley: But if we show up with…

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Tony Atchley: I mean, literally having to have an A-plus game, but if we slow it down.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, establish our running game, and uh… our defense can somehow get in there and kind of.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Tony Atchley: upset his world a little bit. That's… that's our only chance. Only chance.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Duane Brown: That ain't happening.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Tony Atchley: All those things have to align.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, uh, yeah, Zeus has to reach down and touch Miami.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Tony Atchley: So…

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Duane Brown: Hey, I wanted to let you know I was gonna call you today. Um, I'll be going out of town.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Duane Brown: Um, I'll be taking, uh, Friday, uh, February 6th off, and, um…

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Duane Brown: the 9th and 10th. Uh, we're going to Indiana.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Duane Brown: Uh, the University of Indiana. Um, Bob, their… the basketball team's doing their 50-year anniversary.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Duane Brown: Uh, for when they went undefeated, and Bob's part of that process, because he was one of the assistant coaches under Bobby Knight.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Duane Brown: Um, so we're all going to that, and taking Parker to be part of that.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Tony Atchley: Oh, that's cool.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Duane Brown: Um, yeah, because we did that with Ole Miss, too. Um, yeah, and Parker got to go down and, you know, be on the floor with all of Bob's old players, and yeah, I'll have to show you some pictures. It was… it was…

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Duane Brown: pretty amazing. Um, so yeah, I just wanted to give you a heads up on that. I'll put that in the calendar here this week.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Tony Atchley: Okay.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Duane Brown: Um, but yeah, it's gonna be pretty cool.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Duane Brown: Pretty cool. And that's… that's on my bucket list for Parker, you know, for his papa, is to take Parker to the places where he coached.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Duane Brown: You know, so this will be number 2, and then the other two are, you know, Texas, University of Texas, and…

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Tony Atchley: Gotcha.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Duane Brown: and uh… well, actually, 3 others, University of Texas, Florida International, and then South, which is just right here.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Duane Brown: you know, that we can just go over anytime. But yeah, so…

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Tony Atchley: Mm-hmm.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Tony Atchley: Nice, nice.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, it's gonna be… it's gonna be pretty cool.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Tony Atchley: Alright, alright.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Duane Brown: Pretty cool.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Duane Brown: Um, I did send you, uh…

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Duane Brown: The first check request.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna push that through today, um…

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Tony Atchley: And… I've got a…

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Duane Brown: Perkspot sent the full amount, and I had to send Andrew back saying, hey, I thought we talked about doing this quarterly. So he sent a message to their marketing saying, hey, you know, this is supposed to be quarterly, so I haven't received that updated.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Duane Brown: Uh, invoice yet, so…

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Tony Atchley: Okay.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Tony Atchley: Um…

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, I don't know if Eric's traveling this morning, um…

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Tony Atchley: Or not, so I don't know if we're gonna have a…

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Duane Brown: I just got… I just received a message. Um, if we can change the ads, I would do the following. Ask someone on the academic team if they can input stat with Bonnie.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, no-show here from him, so…

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Duane Brown: See if there is a better…

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Duane Brown: Okay, that's in regards to the, uh, Epley & Associates.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Duane Brown: stuff. Okay.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Tony Atchley: Um…

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Duane Brown: I did hear back from Brittany out of marketing, Brittany Armistead.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Duane Brown: Uh, in regards to adding a link to the landing pages, um, that's not something that's gonna happen, like, right away.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Duane Brown: Unless Caroline gets involved with…

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Duane Brown: and Eric with, uh, Dale.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Duane Brown: Um…

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Duane Brown: Because they're doing a huge transition. They're transitioning their whole platform over to, um, HubSpot.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Tony Atchley: Wow.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Duane Brown: Um, the first quarter of this year.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Duane Brown: Um…

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Duane Brown: Yeah.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, we've already heard that, um…

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Tony Atchley: And what I think's gonna have to happen, and, you know, maybe we'll talk about this when we…

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Tony Atchley: Come together this week, um, with some of our, you know, just internal.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Tony Atchley: Here's… here's kind of how we need to navigate, um…

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Tony Atchley: We've been…

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Tony Atchley: Um… well, you've seen some of what…

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, I think Eric did, relative to mocking up some landing pages, yeah.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Duane Brown: Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, he sent me, yeah, oh yeah.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, so, gonna use that more than likely to, um…

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Tony Atchley: Kind of build a case to say, alright, you know, if we can't get marketing resource.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Tony Atchley: Can we, as a… as a one-off, you know, we're not looking to, um…

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, we're looking to be a special case or a pilot, you know, for doing things.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Tony Atchley: On our own, uh, to some extent, relative to this.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Duane Brown: Yeah.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Tony Atchley: And, you know, it's kind of getting buy-in that these are the things that we need to make, you know, a more robust.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Tony Atchley: You know, kind of offering to our clients, a customizable offering.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Tony Atchley: And so, I think that's the way… that's the way I've recommended that, you know, we need to approach it.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Duane Brown: Yeah.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Tony Atchley: I'm trying to give him kind of the lay of the land so that, you know, he knows.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Tony Atchley: how to… how to fight the battle, but, you know, he needs… he definitely needs, um, Caroline's, you know, backing on this. Uh, if she doesn't get behind it, then, you know, it doesn't…

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Duane Brown: That's so… it's… yeah, it's not gonna do anything.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Tony Atchley: It doesn't go anywhere, but at the same time, you can't, you know, we can't have objectives.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Tony Atchley: And be, uh, hamstrung, you know, to…

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Tony Atchley: Not be able to…

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Tony Atchley: uh, offer up the tools, you know, that we need to. So, uh, I think… and we've said all along, you know, this is critical.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Tony Atchley: Um, and the fact that we take a, you know, cookie-cutter approach to them.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Tony Atchley: Um, you know, with the tools that are out there today, it's kind of…

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Tony Atchley: unacceptable, you know, when you look at it, so…

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Duane Brown: Yeah.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Tony Atchley: Anyways…

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Duane Brown: And it's not difficult. I mean, it…

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Tony Atchley: No, it's really not, and I mean, he's… he's kind of proving that point, so…

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Duane Brown: I mean, even if it's just a… and… but, you know, it really can't be a QR code, because, I mean, you want them… I mean, it's just another step for them to have to take a picture of a QR code.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Duane Brown: And then have to do it on their phone, opposed to just hitting the link.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Duane Brown: And going to the landing page.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Duane Brown: But, you know, Brittany did say in her email that, you know, they don't promote any of the, like, the benefit companies or everything, so all of that, and I know the process. I mean, she said, you know, you can go into Omega, you can see the leads and the enrollments, and.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Duane Brown: I haven't responded to her yet, but… but I'm like, okay, I've already been doing that, you know, that's part of my process.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Duane Brown: Um, so…

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Duane Brown: But they aren't taking… I basically… they're not… I would assume they're not trying to take credit for any of the benefit company leads or enrollments.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Duane Brown: You know, by what she said about them not advertising.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Duane Brown: Those, which they're not.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Duane Brown: So…

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Duane Brown: But we'll just… I'll just keep doing it the way I'm doing it.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Duane Brown: Hopefully, uh…

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Duane Brown: Oh, so sorry. Oh, he's in the air, so probably not. Nope.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Duane Brown: He's flying. I think he forgot that he moved at 8.30.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Tony Atchley: Well, I mean, it wouldn't matter, 8.30 or 9, it wouldn't matter.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Duane Brown: He said, he said he should have…

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Duane Brown: He… he said I should have canceled it for the AM.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Tony Atchley: Okay.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Duane Brown: I'm gonna… now, here we go. Oh, I'm gonna bust this chops.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Duane Brown: Oh.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Tony Atchley: I just sent him one, too, so I'll… we'll get him from both.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Duane Brown: You're killing me smalls.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Duane Brown: And then I wanted to let you know.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Duane Brown: that after you left the Christmas party.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Duane Brown: They called your name.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Duane Brown: Because we had talked about that.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Duane Brown: He goes, go up and go up and get it for me. I'm like, I can't do that. Everybody be throwing rocks at me.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. Do they have some nice stuff?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Duane Brown: Oh… oh, man. Yeah, they did. I mean, they had PlayStations, they had Xboxes, they had…

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Duane Brown: Grills, I mean, they…

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Duane Brown: Oh yeah, they did. That's some nice stuff.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Tony Atchley: That, uh… that our team do well?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Duane Brown: Uh, there was somebody on…

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Duane Brown: uh… um… Sherry's side, I think, that won.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Duane Brown: Uh… I can't remember who it was, but I think one person on the corporate side.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, gotcha.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Duane Brown: One, yeah. Yeah, we didn't.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Duane Brown: I even went up to, uh, Aaron Collins and…

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Duane Brown: you know, I said, and I rubbed his head in my forearm, you know, I'm like, okay, man, you need to call my name.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Duane Brown: I used to give his son, um…

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Duane Brown: Gosh, he's with Sherry's team. Uh…

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Duane Brown: Really?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Tony Atchley: Who are you talking about, uh, Garrett?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, Garrett, yeah. I used to give Garrett baseball lessons.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, long time ago. Long… so yeah, I got a scar on my shin, he hit a line drive right off my shin, man.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Duane Brown: Nailed me. Nailed me. Oh, yeah. Yep.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Tony Atchley: Too funny. Too funny.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Duane Brown: That's so funny. Is… is Jim traveling?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Tony Atchley: Hi.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Duane Brown: Is Jim traveling?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Tony Atchley: I don't know, I don't know why he wouldn't be on here this morning, um…

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Duane Brown: Maybe he forgot.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Tony Atchley: So, I don't see anything on the calendar.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Duane Brown: That's okay. It's all good.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Tony Atchley: Uh, for him.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Duane Brown: Maybe he thought because it's training week, everybody's traveling, possibly. Yep.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. Yep.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Tony Atchley: I, you know, I thought that, um… in fact, I've got a call with Randy at 9, um…

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Tony Atchley: I don't know if… well, obviously, Eric won't be on that. Uh, I've got my, um…

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Tony Atchley: annual checkup at 10 this morning, so I gotta head to that. Um…

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Duane Brown: Okay. Gotcha. Everything going okay? Feeling okay?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. But…

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah, feeling great. Feeling great. Yeah, I've got my follow-up to my surgery. Um, it actually should have been at the end of December, but the holidays.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, awesome.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Tony Atchley: uh, messed that up, so I go the 21st for that.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Duane Brown: Oh, wow. Okay.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Tony Atchley: But, um, hopefully I'll get, um, an indication this morning. I went in and did.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Duane Brown: Running a couple… couple weeks late there, huh?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Tony Atchley: Blood work the other day, um, and um.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Tony Atchley: so my PSA reading will be on that today, when I go over it, um…

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Duane Brown: Yeah.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Tony Atchley: So, that'll be kind of an indicator as to, um…

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Duane Brown: Right.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, what's next? So…

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Duane Brown: Gotcha. Cool.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Tony Atchley: Anyways, um, one thing that I do need to get with you on later today, um…

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Tony Atchley: and I'll… I'll pull these back up. We're doing kind of a panel discussion during the meeting on Wednesday, reviewing 2025.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Tony Atchley: And, uh, moving into 26. So, when it comes to, um, one of the things that I put on there was our benefit company kind of rework.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Tony Atchley: um, some of the efforts, uh, including the, uh, the visits. Um, I'll probably tee that up, and I'll, um, let you speak on it.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Tony Atchley: Alright, so, um, it'll be kind of a…

00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Tony Atchley: like I said, uh, panel discussion, kind of going into, um, all the major events and milestones, but at a high level, but kind of given the group.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Tony Atchley: You know, uh, here's… here's what we're doing, here's what we're working on, um, here's observations.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Tony Atchley: Um, you know, from 2025.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Tony Atchley: And, you know, how we're… how we're adjusting to that, some of the, um, some of the things we're gonna do new and different.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Tony Atchley: you know, going into 26. Uh, so that'll be specific to the benefit companies, and I'll let you.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Tony Atchley: You know, have a shining moment there to, uh, be able to talk through. So…

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Duane Brown: Okay. Sounds good, yeah.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, I think he sent something back, the agenda, um, we…

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, I read it. Yeah.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Tony Atchley: Finally, all just got it, so it doesn't look like, um, you know, there's going to be any kind of other individual presentations, uh, for us.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Duane Brown: Oh, I didn't get that agenda. I haven't seen the agenda agenda. I just saw what Eric sent us this morning.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Tony Atchley: Okay, there was something from Caroline.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Duane Brown: Um…

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Tony Atchley: Sunday.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Tony Atchley: Did she… I don't know if there was an attached agenda, or if she was just…

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Duane Brown: That she sent when? Yesterday?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Tony Atchley: Yesterday.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, there's no agenda attached to it.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Tony Atchley: Okay. Um…

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Tony Atchley: So, let me, uh, let me pull up…

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Tony Atchley: Well, there's some sort of attachment on it.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Tony Atchley: What's going on with my email?

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Duane Brown: I… I mean, I'm… I don't… I'm looking at that one, the one before that she sent, like, 3 weeks ago, 1223.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, there's no attachment on the one that she sent.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Duane Brown: Yesterday at, uh, 4.58 PM, is that the one you're talking about?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Tony Atchley: Uh…

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Tony Atchley: Okay, no, that's another one. Sorry about that, yeah.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Duane Brown: Oh, that's okay.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Duane Brown: She must have just sent that to you guys.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Duane Brown: Like you and Eric. Leadership.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, that was, uh, that was something else, that's something we're meeting on Tuesday, so I saw an attachment to it. Um…

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Duane Brown: Oh, okay.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Duane Brown: Gotcha.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Tony Atchley: Let's see…

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Tony Atchley: Let's see… a look back, so the one I was referring to just then, um…

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Tony Atchley: this'll be pretty much from the beginning, right after a welcome. Look back at 25, look forward in 26.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Tony Atchley: Um… then…

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Tony Atchley: Ken comes in at 11.30, Janelle at 1.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Tony Atchley: Um…

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Tony Atchley: Wendy at 2… heck, I'm just gonna… I'm gonna send this to you. Um…

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Duane Brown: Okay.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Tony Atchley: But, um…

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, there's… there's nothing on there for breakouts, no other… no other presentations, so…

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Duane Brown: Gotcha.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, so I don't know what, um…

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Tony Atchley: Eric was referring to when he… he said you might…

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Tony Atchley: Um, have a…

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Duane Brown: Moment.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Tony Atchley: kind of a collapse moment, or… I don't know where he's talking about that fitting in. He's doing some AI training for all of us.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Duane Brown: Yep.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Duane Brown: Got it.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Tony Atchley: At 1 on Thursday, um… yeah.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Tony Atchley: But other than that, um…

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Tony Atchley: So, I'll send this over to you.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Duane Brown: Okay. Cool. Thank you.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Duane Brown: Yeah, just whenever… whenever you're ready later on, just, uh, let me know. Jump on a call.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Tony Atchley: Knowing that.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, and pretty much what I gave you just… just a few minutes ago was, um, was it.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Duane Brown: Okay. I gotcha. Okay. Alright.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, yeah. So, uh, but I'll, um…

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Tony Atchley: you know, I'll tee it up to begin with, and then, you know, just be prepared to kind of…

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Tony Atchley: A high-level summary, 25 bridging over into 26, you know?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Duane Brown: Okay. Do you want any numbers involved in that?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Tony Atchley: Um…

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Duane Brown: With the benefit companies? Not, like, financials, but, like, actual numbers?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah, if it's… if you feel like it's relevant, and, you know, there's something that, uh, kind of stands out.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Duane Brown: Like, enrollments, or…

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Duane Brown: Mm-hmm.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Tony Atchley: That would be useful to the… to the group.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Duane Brown: Well, I think Benna Place would be extremely helpful with the amount of traffic that we saw from them.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah. Yeah.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Duane Brown: In 2025. I mean, I know it wasn't the EBG side, but it was the benefit play side, it was… I mean, that was pretty big.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Tony Atchley: Yeah.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Duane Brown: A lot of… lot of traffic.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Tony Atchley: Gotcha.
